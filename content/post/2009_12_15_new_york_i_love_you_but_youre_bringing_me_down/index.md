Like millions before me, I arrived in New York with a sense of wonder. I had been reading on the train ride into Penn station, so my first glance of the city was when I stepped out onto seventh street. It was a clear midwinter afternoon, and the low sun illuminated the tips of the skyscrapers and filled the streets with a soft light. I was immediately captivated. I had been meaning to come here for a long time, and finally I had made it.

Unless millions before me, however, I had not come from distant shores to build a living here. I was only visiting for an afternoon from New Jersey.


My first action was to find a Starbucks, something I imagined to be a little easier in New York. Eventually, I succeeded, got a coffee, and left through the backdoor into some sort of mall. Uniformed pages showed people around, a group of women was taking pictures of the ceiling. I started to wonder…

Only when stepping out onto fifth street and glancing up the facade, I realized that I had just unknowingly visited the Empire State Building. They should put up signs…


New York is very different from LA. There are no Empire State Buildings, for a start. Also, new York is reigned by pedestrians. As soon as the cars slow down, they start crossing the street, no matter whether it’s red. If you do that in LA, you’ll get fined for jaywalking. Here, you only get fined for not walking.

Nobody asked how I was doing or wished me a good day, and I adapted quickly to the environment. I rolled my eyes at people slowing down, I snarled at people stopping to watch the shop windows. I’m sure New Yorkers have their bad reputation because of visiting Angelinos who enjoy being rude for a day. 


Ok, not true, I did neither of the above. Without looking at anyone, I just walked at a quick pace up the street, headed for Central Park before it gets dark. I saw Macy’s windows and the Rockefeller Center christmas tree. I stopped at a cathedral that stood in stark and comical contrast to the high risers around it, seeking some rest from the bustling streets, but it was just as busy inside as outside. I strolled through the beginning of Central Park and got a bad Espresso and hot chocolate at a hip cafe. Eventually, I swam anonymously through the crowds down Broadway, washed into Penn station, and boarded the next train back to New Jersey. A state that is much nicer than it’s bad reputation. I’m almost sure it’s due to visiting Angelinos…
