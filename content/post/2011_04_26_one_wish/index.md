One thing I wish I was, apart from brilliant, is to be fascinated by boring things. 

Think about it: it would have so many advantages. Like that linear algebra class you had in high school when you could barely stay awake, and now you try to remember how to invert a matrix. Or the list of all the resources that everybody on you project agrees would be really useful to have, but nobody wants to actually sit down and compile it, because the thought alone makes half your brain fall asleep.


If you were excited by all of that, you could get a lot of good work done. On the downside, you might also become the go-to guy for everyone with a boring task. Hey, you can’t have everything! At least you wouldn’t be bored…
