Since the first mentioning of my car here, it has not been washed. As LA is a very dusty city, however, so it was about time to change that. I thus welcomed the fact that a sorority of the local college held a car wash in my street to raise money for a school of blind children. Getting my car washed for a small fee for a good cause―that seemed ike a pretty good deal to me.


Probably a bit too good to be true. For about two hours, I was the happy owner of a shiny car. Then, the long awaited rain set in and washed all the dirt out of the air―and onto my car.


In retalliation, I went and had my hair cut―that was also long overdue, yet it won’t be ruined by the next downpour…

That’ll show the wheather…
