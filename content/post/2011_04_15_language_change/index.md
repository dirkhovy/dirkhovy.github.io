After some deliberation, I decided to write my future posts in English only, to speed up my blogging freqeuency. 


Translation took up too much time, and in some cases prevented me from posting at all. I will catch up on these posts now.


Since my German readers have excellent English skills, this solution leaves nobody out.


You can expect more posts in the future.
