Together with my roommate, I found a great way to prepare chicken. It cooks quickly, stays moist, and is almost impossible to mess up. I made variations of it four times during the last week. Here goes:

- Take chicken breast, pat dry and cut into small strips.

- Put strips in a ziplock bag and add salt and a few table spoons of corn or tapioca starch.

- Heat a pan, add oil.

- Shake chicken strip in a strainer to get rid of excess starch.

- Fry the chicken in pan.


You can stop here and eat the delicious, juicy chicken. The starch creates a thin layer of insulation between meat and pan, so that the chicken cooks more evenly and doesnâ€™t dry out. You can add other spices to the starch, if you are so inclined. Allspice is pretty awesome. 


Or you can go in to make an orange chicken that beats the crap out of anything you get at a Chinese fast-food restaurant:


- Mix the juice from 3 limes with the same amount of orange juice and some fermented chili sauce.

- Add to the cooked chicken strips.

- Reduce until strips are just coated with a thin film.


Enjoy!
