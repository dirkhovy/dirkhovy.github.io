For some time now, I have been a subscriber to the magazine  “Cooks Illustrated”.  A friend described it as  “food porn”, but the focus is less on sensual pleasure than on scientific analysis (you know that a food magazine is serious if they print in two columns, and only in B/W). 

Recipes are varied ingredient by ingredient, tested and the outcome reported, until you get the best possible result. In addition, you get tricks and tips and kitchen tool reviews.


My absolute favorite by now is a recipe for ricotta. Super easy, fast, and very delicious! And a worthy replacement for the unobtainable Quark. Here’s my  version (original in Cooks ilustrated Oct 2009):


Heat a gallon of whole milk with a tablespoon salt to 185°F, or until surface slightly ripples. Take off the flame and add 1/3rd cup of lemon juice. Let stand for 5 minutes. If the consistency is not curdly enough, add another tablespoon of lemon juice. Repeat until there are no more changes in the consistency. Skim off the mass with a strainer and put it in a colander lined with kitchen towel. Put over a bowl and leave overnight in the fridge. 


The next morning, you have fresh ricotta, somewhere between cream and cottage cheese. Tested in pasta and with honey for dessert.


Guten Appetit!
