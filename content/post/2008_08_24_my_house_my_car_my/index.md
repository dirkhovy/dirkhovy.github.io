 “When I arrived, all I had were two bags full of stuff, and now I am the owner of…” 


We all know the stories starting out like that. They are part of the topos America, just as the rich uncle and the dish washer turned millionaire.

In my case, however, the story is not that compelling yet―I have neither founded a global trading empire nor bought a villa with celebrity neighbours in Beverly Hills. In fact, I still do not even own a room yet.

Yet my possession has grown considerately since the notorious two bags.


Since yesterday, I own a new iPhone and―just borrowed, though―an old car. What the car lacks in glamour is made up for by the phone: It is chic, shiny, easy to use out of the box―and devours battery like there is no tomorrow.

I hate to admit it, yet with both I am pretty much in line with the current L.A. trend: While a year ago the streets were full of cars that consumed more fuel on starting than a weekend trip through Europe did, fuel efficiency is now the new cool.  And with the radical consequence that characterizes Americans and especially Californians, they have changed the outlook of their streets.

I do not dare to tell people that they still pay half the price they would in Germany―if they set their minds on energy conscious living, who am I to stop them? My car will play its part, and my conscience can be at peace. Yet is my phone a green one?
