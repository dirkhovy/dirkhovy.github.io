One of the questions posed most frequently to me over the last few days was  “How’s the weather?” Quite understandable if you are from a country that―due to changing metereological conditions―has something like weather.


Here in L.A., however, the weatherforecast is about as interesting as election results from a totalitarian regime: You know beforehand what it’s going to be. In this case: 80°F plusminus 5, a little cooler in the mornings and evenings.


That may sound great, yet after a few days you get used to it. You also find out quickly that the clouds you see in the morning will have disappeared until noon.

As exciting as the city is otherwise, the weather is rather bland.


At least this has the advantage that you can spend more time worrying about other things than umbrellas and warm socks. For example forms. But that is another story. One you just have to weather…
