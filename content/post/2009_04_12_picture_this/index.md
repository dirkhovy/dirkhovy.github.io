Picture the late morning sun over LA, lazily shining through the open front door of a single storey house. As it crosses the threshold, it passes waves of Tango music, floating out into the Easter Sunday.  As it hits the battered hardwood floor, legs move swiftly through the beam, wearing high heels and dancing shoes. On a table in the kitchen wait banana pancakes, tamales, fruit, and orange juice for the dancers.

What a perfect way of celebrating Easter…
