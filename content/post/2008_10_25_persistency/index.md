Behind the left rear mirror of my car lives a little spider, which comes out every night and weaves her net between the door and the mirror. And every morning when I get into my car, I remove the net. 

It is nothing personal from my side, and in secret, I even admire her persistency, but it has become some sort of ritual. 

Maybe there is something I can learn from it: Get out every morning and weave your webâ€¦

Or probably I just have to start to wash my car properly.
