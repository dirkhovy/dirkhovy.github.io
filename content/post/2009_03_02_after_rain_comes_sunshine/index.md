 “You write so infrequently”, I hear quite often.  “I have too much to do,” I then reply. That is true, but there is of course  more. Everyone likes to hear good news, or at least exciting ones. And in recent weeks, there was not much of either of them. Not only the global economy, also my life showed signs of unhappy development. And the Californian sun was behind thick clouds. 


Back from Germany, I got really aware of how far away I am. Not only geographically, also mentally. My attempt to tell people here about Germany showed me how much I’ve taken for granted, how little things I questioned or had consciously perceived. How does the German insurance system work, what exactly does the Bundespräsident do, why  are there Haupt and Real schools (and how do they translate), and where is the difference between the Bundesrat and Bundestag? 


At the same time I am still a foreigner here: I know no American lullabies, was spared from high school hell, and so far I have never thought about my credit report. I felt like sitting between all chairs. I even thought my English was deteriorating.


In addition, my research inched forward slowly, I long puzzled over my schedule, and there were some things in my private life I had to set straight. Nothing great, but in sum unnerving. My morale was struck. To make matters worse, in February, I had an accident. No physical consequences, but the car was out, and that in LA is synonymous with disaster. The low point was reached. 


Perhaps a good thing, because from there on it went uphill. After a shock, you can  see things more clearly: I have reorganized my week, redefined my targets, and  concentrated on fewer things, but with more energy. And that did it. I am happier and more content than before, university and job are fun again, and the thing with the car was also taken care of. The insurance was helpful and friendly, many people have given me advice and practical help, and since yesterday I’m glad the owner of a bright red Nissan Versa. I am still a foreigner, but I am not the only one. And it can be quite charming, too. Just what the deal with Hauptschulen is escapes me still…


So, this is it! After every rain there’s sunshine, even and especially in California…
