Welcome!

I am a Professor in the [Computing Sciences Department of Bocconi University](https://cs.unibocconi.eu/) in Milan, where I lead the [MilaNLP](https://milanlproc.github.io/) lab together with [Debora Nozza](http://www.deboranozza.com).
I am also the scientific director of the [Data and Marketing Insights](www.dmi.unibocconi.eu/) research unit. 
Previously, I was CS faculty at the University of Copenhagen, got a PhD from USC's Information Sciences Institute, and a linguistics master's in Germany.

I am interested in the interaction between language, society, and machine learning, or **what computers can tell us about language and what language can tell us about society**. I am also interested in ethical questions of bias and algorithmic fairness in machine learning.

I have authored over [150 articles on these topics](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7xluaTAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), including 3 best and one outstanding paper awards, and have published [two](https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/text-analysis-in-python-for-social-scientists/BFAB0A3604C7E29F6198EA2F7941DFF3) [textbooks](https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/abs/text-analysis-in-python-for-social-scientists/54B82AEA3FB586919A2265E6799ACB11) on text processing in Python for social scientists.

I co-founded and organized several workshops (on [computational social science](https://sites.google.com/site/nlpandcss/), and [ethics in NLP](http://ethicsinnlp.com/)), and I was a local organizer for the EMNLP 2017 conference.
I was awarded an ERC Starting Grant project 2020 for research on demographic bias in NLP.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, leather-crafting, and picking up heavy things to put them back down.
