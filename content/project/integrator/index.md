Dirk Hovy, scientific director of DMI and Professor of computer science, has won an **ERC starting grant of 1.5mln euros**. His project INTEGRATOR, funded under grant agreement 949944, **introduces demographic factors into language processing systems**, which will improve algorithmic performance, avoid racism, sexism, and ageism, and open up new applications.
What if I wrote that “winning an ERC Grant, Dirk Hovy got a sick result?”. Those familiar with the use of “sick” as a synonym for “great” or “awesome” among teenagers would think that Bocconi Knowledge hired a very young writer (or someone posing as such). The rest would think I went crazy. Current artificial intelligence-based language systems wouldn’t have a clue. “Natural language processing (NLP) technologies,” Prof. Hovy says, “fail to account for demographics both in understanding language and in generating it. And this failure prevents us from reaching human-like performance. It limits possible future applications and it introduces systematic bias against underrepresented demographic groups”.
