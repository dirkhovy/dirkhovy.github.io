abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our daily
  lives and personalized. However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended
  side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to falsely
  refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent of this issue.
  To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15 sociodemographic personas (based
  on gender, race, religion, and disability) on false refusal. To control for other
  factors, we also test 16 different models, 3 tasks (Natural Language Inference,
  politeness, and offensiveness classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose
  a Monte Carlo-based method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner.
  Our results show that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal
  rate less. However, we find that the choice of model significantly influence false
  refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. The impact of certain sociodemographic
  personas further increases the false refusal effect in some models, which suggests
  that there are underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety mechanisms.
