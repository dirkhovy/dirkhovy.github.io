abstract: "Natural Language Processing has seen impressive gains in recent years. This research includes the demonstration by NLP models to have turned into useful technologies with improved capabilities, measured in terms of how well they match human behavior captured in web-scale language data or through annotations. However, human behavior is inherently shaped by the cultural contexts humans are embedded in, the values and beliefs they hold, and the social practices they follow, part of which will be reflected in the data used to train NLP models, and the behavior these NLP models exhibit. This workshop will bring together NLP researchers invested in this work, along with a community of scholars with multi-disciplinary expertise spanning linguistics, social sciences, and cultural anthropology."
