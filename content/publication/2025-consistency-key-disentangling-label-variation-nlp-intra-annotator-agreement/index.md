abstract: We commonly use agreement measures to assess the utility of judgements made
  by human annotators in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. While inter-annotator
  agreement is frequently used as an indication of label reliability by measuring
  consistency between annotators, we argue for the additional use of intra-annotator
  agreement to measure label stability (and annotator consistency) over time. However,
  in a systematic review, we find that the latter is rarely reported in this field.
  Calculating these measures can act as important quality control and could provide
  insights into why annotators disagree. We conduct exploratory annotation experiments
  to investigate the relationships between these measures and perceptions of subjectivity
  and ambiguity in text items, finding that annotators provide inconsistent responses
  around 25% of the time across four different NLP tasks.

  Testing for inter-annotator agreement? Good. However, also check consistency over
  time: we find that annotators provide inconsistent responses around 25% of the time.
