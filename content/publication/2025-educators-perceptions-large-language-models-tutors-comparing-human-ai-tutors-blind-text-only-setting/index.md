abstract: "The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) opens up the possibility
  of using them aspersonal tutors. This has led to the development of several intelligent
  tutoring systems and learning assistants that use LLMs as back-ends with various
  degrees of engineering. In this study, we seek to compare human tutors with LLM
  tutorsin terms of engagement, empathy, scaffolding, and conciseness. We ask human
  tutors to compare the performance of an LLM tutor with that of a human tutor in
  teaching grade-school math word problems on these qualities. We find that annotators
  with teaching experience perceive LLMs as showing higher performance than human
  tutors in all 4 metrics. The biggest advantage is in empathy, where 80% of our annotators
  prefer the LLM tutor more often than the human tutors. Our study paints a positive
  picture of LLMs as tutors and indicates that these models can be used to reduce
  the load on human teachers in the future."

  Do teachers like LLMs? We find they rate LLM tutors over humans on engagement, empathy,
  scaffolding, & conciseness for grade-school math, hinting they could help reduce
  teacher workload.
