1,"if the 70 ' s nostalgia didn ' t make you feel old , the 80 ' s nostalgia is bound to . one of the latter set , "" the wedding singer , "" seems to be written by someone who did not experience the 1980 ' s directly but only read about them in an article in parade magazine . the wacky fashions are here . . . and the music . . . and references aplenty to celebrities and signs of the times , but it all seems tediously - and too obviously - inserted for the didn ' t - we - dress - funny - back - then chuckle . the plot is standard romantic comedy with nothing original : robbie ( adam sandler ) is a wedding singer ; julia ( drew barrymore ) waits tables at weddings . both are engaged ; however , robbie ' s fiance ( angela featherstone ) dumps him at the altar , and julia ' s fiance ( matthew glave ) is a skirt - chasing speculator in junk bonds . robbie and julia go through the expected ups - and - downs as they realize they were meant to be together . i ' ll fess up - i ' ve never found adam sandler funny . whatever his appeal is , i ' ve missed it .

2,"you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they ' re as real as life . i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person ' s brain with microwaves . then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections . i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted . these people had what are known as "" conspiracy theories "" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public . a little imagination goes a long way . in richard donner ' s conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything . his latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day ' s work for him . he combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings - on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions . upstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned . lucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since . what she doesn ' t know is that jerry ' s interest in her is far more than , well , professional . he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment . but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry ' s ideas and his limited - circulation "" conspiracy theory "" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice ' s help . one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action - thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills . part of this is a result of the film ' s slow pace . it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement . at over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it ' s running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film . instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we ' re treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite "" black elements "" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill . they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time . big deal , we ' ve seen it all before . watching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . now , when i say it took forever to set up the "" relationship "" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . oh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . you see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory . the two just don ' t click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he ' s been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced . the script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us . dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . even gibson ' s usual gift for ad lib couldn ' t punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry ' s theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing . unfortunately , much of what ' s discussed in the film is not inherently important to what ' s going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it ' s never followed through . for example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station . he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man ' s lungs for chlorine . this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him . you know what happens then ? nothing , zip , nada . no follow - up whatsoever , so what ' s the significance ? okay , here ' s another one . a couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel "" the catcher in the rye "" . jerry also has a bunch of copies . whenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one . leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we ' re never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin . not when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question . the point becomes totally extraneous . oh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? yeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy . that ' s about it . for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he ' s nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory . you can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi . this guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time . okay , here ' s my theory . this really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true ! the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over .",neg,think people only exist movie trust ' re as real life once talk

3,""" knock off "" is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie . it ' s also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year . i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found . jean - claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half - brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods . rob schneider plays van damme ' s partner , and rochon plays . . . actually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be . she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there . many things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick . where chan comes off as endearing in his "" normal guy "" character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp . we ' re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions . to be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear . the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong . tsui hark ( who directed van damme ' s last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , "" double team "" ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that ' s no exaggeration . we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme ' s foot entering a shoe . fabulous ! seriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don ' t get carried away . for example , look at sam raimi . "" army of darkness "" , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story . that ' s a concept that tsui can ' t seem to grasp . the special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * "" knock off "" to the point where the audience doesn ' t have a clue as to what ' s happening any more . another problem with the film is that it looks cheap . the film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night . and for some inexplicable reason , everyone ' s voice seems to have been dubbed . even the stars . and even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent . for example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window . the car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed . seconds later , the car drives off at full speed . hey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere . finally , the acting . nobody gives a good performance in this film . van damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing "" everyman "" . and schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene . even the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over - the - top performance as . . . once again , i have no idea who he was supposed to be . in case i haven ' t yet made it clear enough , "" knock off "" is the worst movie of van damme ' s career and possibly the worst movie of the decade . and it ' s not even one of those movies that ' s so bad it ' s funny . it ' s too inept to be funny . there are no redeeming factors in "" knock off "" and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased .",neg,knock be exactly cheap knock action movie ' s also bad movie have see thus far year figure be least couple month see bad film have already be find jean claude van damme star think designer jean executive discover half brother have be supply cheap good rob schneider play van damme s partner rochon play actually have idea rochon be suppose be just sort of pop halfway through explanation why be there many thing be explain film do know bizarre reason van damme seem be do jackie chan impression flick where chan come endear normal guy character see many film van damme just come wimp ' re never give clear explanation basis many action be more clear do even know be suppose be about hour movie even then be make too clear film have be direct style strange film experiment go horribly wrong tsui hark direct van damme last movie bad nearly as bad double team never let camera rest second s exaggeration be even treat second shot point view van damme foot enter shoe fabulous seriously though have problem director want play film convention as long don t get carry away example look sam raimi army darkness good movie feature most inventive camera work have ever see raimi never let special effect get way story s concept tsui ' t seem grasp special effect outrageous camera angle rule knock point where audience doesn t have clue s happen more problem film be look cheap film stock use be such low caliber think be watch chinese film show really late night inexplicable reason s voice seem have be dub even star even special effect seemingly only aspect film director actually care be inconsistent example be scene van damme drive car window car slam ground left wheel be completely destroy second later car drive full speed have problem suspend disbelief action movie line be draw somewhere finally acting give good performance film van damme actor usually like be way mark play everyman schneider here provide comic relief assume be totally unfunny over act way scene even usually solid paul sorvino give terribly top performance once again have idea be suppose be case haven t yet make clear enough knock be bad movie van damme s career possibly bad movie decade ' s even movie s so bad ' s funny ' s too inept be funny be redeem factor knock seriously hope print film be burn crisp somehow memory watch film be erase
4,"brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly . since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames . consequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito ' s way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes . it doesn ' t hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . carlito ' s way , while hampered by depalma ' s characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . carlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life - long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance . in 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality . he declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas . among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito ' s crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) . carlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace . old ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can ' t seem to shake . carlito ' s way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . in the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station . both highlight depalma ' s gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely . yet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit . but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there ' s more of an immediacy to carlito ' s way , an ever - present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . you sense that there ' s no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . indeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : "" you don ' t get reformed ; you just run out of wind . "" pacino captures carlito ' s dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . sean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder . he could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting . as compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . from a story standpoint , there ' s an obligatory love story with a cliche ' d long - suffering girlfriend character . penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn ' t do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . still , it ' s easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn ' t break . carlito ' s way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well - rewarded .",pos,brian depalma need hit really badly score big untouchable depalma have see casualty war raise cain particularly disastrous bonfire vanity go flame consequently be easy enough consider carlito way shrewd commercial choice depalma reteame al pacino scarface return gangland ground have yield great box office success doesn t hurt have latch solid story bring dynamite performance pacino sean penn carlito s way hamper depalma characteristic excess stylistic cannibalism be truly tense engross drama carlito brigante pacino be life long criminal find unexpectedly give second chance carlito be release prison serve only year year sentence when conviction be overturn technicality declare reform tired life street determine fulfill simple dream buy rental car business bahama find conversion hard believe be david kleinfeld carlito crooked attorney childhood friend bodyguard pachanga luis guzman carlito rediscover old flame gail penelope ann miller seem ready retire peace old way die hard though old associate pull carlito step step back life ' t seem shake carlito way probably make strong impression outstanding set piece bracket film first carlito accompany young cousin drug buy have pulse edge seat film close equally thrilling chase new york subway grand central station highlight depalma gift choreographed mayhem be only occasion when stage blood flow freely viscera find character study even more compelling carlito brigante have lot michael corleone age gangster try unsuccessfully go legit where culmination godfather saga play opera more immediacy carlito s way ever present sense doom launch title sequence set flashback story motion sense s way so many year carlito stay trouble indeed observe attempt straight life be more function time change heart don t get reform just run wind pacino capture carlito dilemma surprising subtlety cautious observation borne year experience watch corner enemy sean penn be even well turn good performance date kleinfeld jew world puerto rican italian wiseguy kleinfeld be outsider huge chip shoulder have be simply pathetic heavy drinker cocaine addict play tough guy way league penn invest kleinfeld tremendous nervous energy overwhelming survival instinct show man move steadily brink make moment go quite jolt as compelling narrative be viewer experience profound sense depalma continue steal shamelessly other director time add scorsese repertoire point view tracking shoot copacabana scene more pass resemblance goodfellas even recycle own previous plagiarism degree swing kiss vertigo body double climactic shootout strike many as far too reminiscent train station sequence untouchable story standpoint s obligatory love story cliche long suffer girlfriend character penelope ann miller be good limited actor doesn t do new role eventually become just distraction never integrate fully enough story still ' s easy be forgive superficial flaw when backbone be so solid principle character hold iron grip attention cinematic thievery world couldn t break carlito way play tragic novel deliberate confident powerful willing grant depalma tendency extreme find well reward
5,"attention moviegoers : you are about to enter a meaning - free zone . should the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes , do not panic . the film will work just as well as a silent movie . chronicling the meaningless lives of vain , yuppie types , the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films ( last days of disco , barcelona and metropolitan ) but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing . first - time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth . there isn ' t one of these characters worth caring about . the movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of "" people magazine . "" among others , the movie features : ben affleck , casey affleck , david chappelle , janeane garofalo , gaby hoffmann , catherine kellner , courtney love , jay mohr , martha plimpton , christina ricci and paul rudd . and unlike people magazine , the people speak , not that they have anything interesting to say . it ' s new year ' s eve in 1981 , and monica ( martha plimpton ) is preparing her big party . structured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party , director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars . monica ' s apartment is in "" noho , "" an area that one of the guests describes as "" so cool , all of the poor people live there .

6,"it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire . usually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein . to qualify , you ' d have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you ' d at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel ' s throat . but today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy - looking , long - haired , unshaven lout or any spiked - haired harridans can put the bite on you . by the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors . not in these times . all you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade . without sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity . which brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half . not only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after - hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower . with all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims . you also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry - cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains . blade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual . the plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost . it ' s all hokum and nonsense , of course . but the filmmakers play it straight . unfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn ' t see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings . you know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter . another tell - tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero ' s costume more than the hero . also it seems it ' s not enough for today ' s vampire merely to have fangs . he must also be proficient in the martial arts . why a supernatural being , one of the undead , needs such skills is beyond me .

8,"capsule : godawful "" comedy "" that ' s amazingly shabby and cut - rate , and rather bereft of laughs . i was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers : international man of mystery . i desperately needed something to cheer me up , or at least distract me so i could get a clear head . get some perspective . even dumb movies can do that for me , sometimes . i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment , but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery . michael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five - minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film , padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props - strategically - positioned - between - naked - actors - and - camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago . the plot , what little there is of it : back in the swinging mod hep sixties ( i don ' t think i ' m doing a disservice to the movie ' s attempted early look and feel by describing it that way ) , sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr . evil . evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later , when powers was out of the picture . powers also had himself frozen , and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with . the basic gag , that of powers ' total inability to cope with the nineties , is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with . the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics : james bond gags ( of which this movie has no end , right down to the silly character names ) , inept slapstick , toilet humor , and strategically placed props . . . the movie ' s amazingly bereft of ideas , come to think of it , with a couple of bright exceptions . one is dr . evil ' s son -- there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group , chaired by carrie fisher -- and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch ( it ' s a visual gag -- hard to describe , and hard to recommend seeing the movie for ) . a lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie , but it ' s desperate rather than clever . instead of skewering the whole thing , it ' s a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute . myers himself is also desperate : he ' s given an idea to play , not a character . plus , the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy ( albeit "" nineties "" ) agent are a waste of time . i wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her , only to have her deck him one . with a couple of exceptions , the movie misses all of its own best moments . the movie even looks cheesy , and not in a good way : i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi - def video or something , so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes . the whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap . my definition of comedy is simply : did it make me laugh ?

9,"drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside - the one who ' s the awkward klutz or the spunky do - it - yourselfer ; the one who just doesn ' t fit in with the others . she has perfected these characters in movies such as "" the wedding singer "" and , most notably , "" ever after . "" now she ' s back , starring in what could be called a modern - day cinderella fable - "" never been kissed . "" you know it ' s a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary . trust me on this one , no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg ( and i don ' t mean steve ) invented the printing press . the premise is simple . barrymore ' s josie geller , at 25 the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun - times , is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what today ' s teens are feeling and doing . josie ( she says she was named after the ' 70s cartoon character ) was a geek in high school , so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance . this time , she thinks , she will get it right and be accepted by the in - crowd . now , what kind of adult - with a good job and a successful career - would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was - and is - high school and adolescence . these are among the many problems that plague "" never been kissed . "" screenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get a handle of josie . their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy , blubbering woman - child at the least provocation . and the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high school ' s most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability . ok , so "" never been kissed "" is not a sociological expose of today ' s high school scene . however , certain rules should apply to film , and one of those is consistency of character . among the movie ' s problems is the ill - conceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and , in the process , lose focus on her assignment . any competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say "" get me rewrite . "" to be fair , barrymore is very appealing , but she is given very little to work with . she tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character , but the script continually undermines her . barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk , talk and act like a cool , hip high schooler . otherwise , she is left foundering on a cliched sea of teen - age stereotypes and situations . "" never been kissed "" is entertaining and funny in fits and starts . it lacks consistency and a firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish . the movie ' s main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys , the outsider who befriends new student josie . josie sees a lot of her former self in aldys , yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls . real mature . and that is the main deficiency with "" never been kissed .

10,"when andy leaves for cowboy camp , his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys . one of these toys is wheezy , a penguin with a broken squeaker . woody ( tom hanks ) saddles up andy ' s dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy . woody succeeds in his mission , but doesn ' t make it back to the house before al , the unscrupulous owner of al ' s toy barn , recognizes woody as a rare collector ' s item and steals him . buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) leads hamm ( john ratzenberger ) , mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , slinky dog ( jim varney ) , and rex ( wallace shawn ) into the city to find their friend . meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped . al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950 ' s tv puppet show "" woody ' s round - up "" except for a woody doll . now that the collection is complete , al plans to sell woody and his round - up gang - bullseye the horse , jessie the cowgirl ( joan cusack ) , and stinky pete the old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) - to a toy museum in japan . the gang is happy about the move ; they ' ve been in storage for years waiting for woody . if woody doesn ' t go with them , they ' ll be closed up in a dark box again , possibly forever . trying to convince him to stay with them , jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up , and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered . while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy , buzz and the boys invade al ' s toy barn , where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn ' t know he ' s a toy . the new buzz generates the movie ' s biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on "" zurg ' s fortress "" ( i . e . , al ' s apartment building ) . the original "" toy story "" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown - up sensibility rather than the usual this - is - what - we - think - kids - want - to - hear . while most kids ' movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill , in "" toy story "" buzz discovered that he wasn ' t special , that he was just like everyone else . buzz sank into a suicidal depression , but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy . in other words , it ' s okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life . most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we ' re not space rangers and we ' re never going to be . "" toy story 2 "" addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie . woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded , abandoned , or sealed up in a dark box in the attic . this is another big grown - up theme : everything ends . the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody ' s arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp . on the shelf , woody meets wheezy , who ' s dusty , broken , and forgotten . the other toys are shocked that woody has been "" shelved , "" and they worry that woody ' s ride out to the 25 - cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt . after he ' s stolen , woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals . of course , in spite of the heavy themes "" toy story 2 "" explores , it ' s also very funny . most of the laughs come from the toys ' assault on al ' s toy barn and on the apartment building . the brief substitution of a new , still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise ; i ' d wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original . most of the vocal performances are first - rate . tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work . however , one voice - over also stands out as horribly miscast . kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector . although he does a lot of voice - over work in commercials and on "" the simpsons "" ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice . he doesn ' t have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete . the animation is even better than in the first . especially impressive were the textures of the figures . we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic ; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint . we can also see that bo peep is porcelain . as you can tell from the long - winded phrasing common in the merchandising -- "" disney and pixar ' s ' toy story 2 ' "" -- this is pixar ' s coming out party . to celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie . they made the short in 1986 , which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then . on the downside , "" toy story 2 "" follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale , and some sections tend to drag . overall , though , i had a great time and found "" story 2 "" to be a worthy successor to the first "" toy story .

11,"with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous "" ellen "" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . then along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . it ' s also noticeable that this "" alternative lifestyle "" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . while it ' s a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . but the way we ' re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . it doesn ' t poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it ' s comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids - afflicted gay man in philadelphia . if you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . it ' s a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . it ' s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . kevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . after a three - year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . the small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . when cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . everyone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , "" and he ' s gay . "" the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . the thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . naturally the questions pour from howard ' s fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school ' s principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . the frenzy isn ' t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and "" entertainment tonight "" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . one particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of "" inside entertainment "" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . the intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . it seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . the dominoes begin to tumble as howard ' s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . it all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren ' t presented with near -

12,"there ' s good news and bad news about mulan . the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy - handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules . on the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast . but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney ' s best animated feature since the lion king . after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians . mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever - popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married . that ' s what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming - na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her . cartoons . . . meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns . since mulan ' s a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go . she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family . that ' s chinese culture for you . . . so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father ' s uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place . the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army . it should have been called g . i . chang . mulan calls on her ancestors for help . they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up . voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges . murphy ' s performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad - libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they ' re going to have . you ain ' t never had a friend like mushu . speaking of songs , mulan doesn ' t have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this . disney songs about war probably wouldn ' t go over too well ( "" heigh ho , heigh ho , it ' s off to war i go . . . "" ) , and the ones they do have aren ' t memorable . the best of the bunch , sad to say , is "" be a man , "" the requisite basic training montage song . yes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle . sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , "" be a man "" accompanies footage of mulan ' s platoon going from screw - ups to heroes . it makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that ' s ended badly ? i only wish real - life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage . for the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl . all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder - length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china . the deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12 - year - old boy , at best . but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil - eyed attilla - looking monster . as a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable . i saw the movie yesterday and i don ' t remember the man ' s name . otherwise , mulan is a good movie . the animation of the characters themselves isn ' t as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots . eddie murphy pulls off some good one - liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star . hell , george "" mr . sulu "" takei does a voice in mulan . you get the sense disney said to themselves , "" alright , let ' s get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood . who can you think of ?

14,"whenever writer / director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms . he made the west dirty in "" mccabe and mrs . miller "" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard - boiled detective stories in "" the long goodbye "" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with "" popeye "" ( 1980 ) . the same holds true for his most recent film , "" the gingerbread man , "" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie . by the time "" the gingerbread man "" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham . there ' s no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o ' donnell or matt damon , and it doesn ' t feature a great showdown in a courtroom . instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , "" the gingerbread man "" is a rain - soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman ' s trademark full - frontal female nudity . the central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham ' s other lawyer heroes . he is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry - red $ 80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds . rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) . a reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn ' t hard to surmise that rick ' s womanizing had a large part in it . whenever he ' s late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it ' s because he ' s been "" screwing around . "" after an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn ' t lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses . he drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together . rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare - footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers . it was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does "" weird "" stuff like that . as another character puts it , dixon is "" a few beers short of six - pack . "" rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency . he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory ' s begrudging ex - husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) . dixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out . from there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double - crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action . altman ' s cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look . if it isn ' t night - time , at least it ' s raining . gu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light . a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability . in the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world . altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies . but , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings . "" the gingerbread man "" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here . however , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action / thriller . a great deal of the credit for the film ' s success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction . here , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic . rick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . without it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick ' s pain and frustration . the supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart - breaking role as the jewish maid in "" schindler ' s list "" ( 1993 ) . tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on - screen time just looking weird . it doesn ' t seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film ' s one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing . while "" the gingerbread man "" isn ' t in league with altman ' s greatest works like "" nashville "" ( 1975 ) or "" the player "" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career . some critics love to stamp films like this as "" commercial , "" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don ' t make money . altman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more .",pos,whenever writer director robert altman work specific genre have tendency rewrite own term make west dirty mccabe mrs miller parody hard boil detective story long goodbye transform cartoon flesh blood popeye same hold true most recent film gingerbread man reinvent genre have develop exponential rate last year john grisham movie time gingerbread man be complete be very little evidence be ever base story grisham s idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise matthew mcconaughey chris o donnell matt damon doesn t feature great showdown courtroom instead be grand ode power legal profession gingerbread man be rain soak southern gothic noir thriller wildly eccentric character twisting plot line black humor somewhat bleak ending even altman trademark full frontal female nudity central character film be rick magruder be grisham other lawyer hero be old experienced rich drive cherry red mercede never get dirty even incessantly pour rain savannah georgia where story unfold rick be midst ugly divorce wife leeanne famke janssen rarely get see child jeff jesse jame libby mae whitman reason be never give divorce isn t hard surmise rick womanizing have large part whenever ' s late pick kid visitation day leeanne always assume ' s ' s be screw around office party celebrate court victory hasn t lose year rick become involve mallory doss embeth davidtz catering waitress drive home car have be steal end bed together rick find mallory be be terrorize stalk slightly psychotic father dixon doss robert duvall grungy stringy bare footed old man lead commune other greasy old codger be actually dixon steal car night when rick ask why mallory reply always do weird stuff character put dixon be few beer short pack rick end convince mallory have dixon bring court try competency succeed information dig clyde pell private investigator friend robert downey testimony mallory begrudge ex -

"" who are these jedi knights ? "" i asked . "" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine - gun rapidity ? "" "" why aren ' t these characters being developed before their adventures ? "" "" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? "" these were just some of my questions early on . later , i asked , "" where ' s the magic of the first three films ? "" and "" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? ' by the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed . george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster . the phantom menace is no star wars film . take away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you ' re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time . it ' s an embarrassment . i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn ' t used . there are a few of each , but they ' re all token attempts . the fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects . this is not what i wanted to see . i didn ' t want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did . the story centers mostly around qui - gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi - wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo . naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people . after picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) . qui - gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys . the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters . there isn ' t anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form . the way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory . first of all , we don ' t learn one single thing about qui - gon jinn . not one thing . what was his life like before this film ? well , i imagine he didn ' t have one . that ' s why he feels like a plot device . this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he ' s recently retired from film ( i don ' t blame him , honestly ) . obi - wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting . mcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere . since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie . things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed - out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role . i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting . and when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving . also fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written . jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i ' ve ever had to endure , but he ' s more interesting than most of the humans . as soon as the relatively - brief segment on tatooine is over , it ' s back to the mind - numbing special effects and depthless action scenes . i ' ve seen many movies that qualify as "" special effects extravaganzas , "" but the phantom menace is the first one i ' ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie . the reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint . i can ' t say that i didn ' t find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi - wan , and qui - gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film . but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome . my breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away . can ' t we have one stinking scene that isn ' t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ? i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours . and then there ' s the question of magic . what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel . john williams ' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas ' direction . i think it comes right down to characters : there are none here . i longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing . and what about the ridiculous expectations ? mine weren ' t that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects . instead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show . i don ' t hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i ' d like to forget that it exists , and yet i can ' t . it ' s here to stay . i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they don ' t , then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series .",neg,star war episode phantom menace director george lucas cast liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman jake lloyd ian mcdiarmid samuel l . jackson oliver ford davy terence stamp pernilla august frank ahme good kenny baker anthony daniels screenplay george lucas producer rick mccallum runtime min distribution 20th century fox rate pg mild violence thematic element copyright nathaniel r atcheson fellow critic once state belief reviewer speak own review ' ve attempt obey rule recent month do so be impossible case fact be nearly person go see phantom menace bring baggage original star war trilogy mean so much so many people calibrate creativity child be masterful original work art mix move story be astonishing special effect time still hold pretty darn well be too young have see star war theater original release doesn t make less dedicated contrary star war trilogy empire strike back particular be item very short list why love movie when hear george lucas be make first trilogy film series get exit when first see screenshot film well year ago embark year long drool anticipation when first preview be release last thanksgiving be ready see film then be hype insane marketing campaign lucasfilm secretive snobbery picture last week picture open multitude fan wait outside theater stand boil sun day advance just be first one theater be tired hear be tired see cardboard cut out character whenever go kfc taco bell just want see movie reader do misunderstand do have anti -

have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then - technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ? it sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal . determined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them . it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket . when lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win . but the joy in a film like this is in the little details . for example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class . if he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer . it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does . it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal - mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again . homer + s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ . here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal - miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions . this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi - dimensional his character is . he is his son + s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son + s dreams . but he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how . through coal - mining . because of his character , we can see how far we + ve come . the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us . we don + t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family . the paradigm was shifting under the father + s feet , and he knew of no other life . so _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel - good inspirational film , offers much food for thought . and this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you . btw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal - moving white dot against the night - sky background . another commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago .",pos,when _ star war _ come year ago image travel star have become commonplace image when millenium falcon move star see constellation meteor shower cool space ship when han solo go light speed star change bright line go viewer line converge invisible point october sky offer much simple image single white dot travel horizontally night sky be really only year ago when sputnik be launch then satellite ever exist have become so technologically advanced have forget be nearly generation ago where people stand outside breathlessly see then technological achievement even be russian sound hokey when scene occur beginning _ october sky _ find catch enthusiasm homer hickam play jake gyllenhaal determine make dent space race become transfix desire make rocket fly good be film know ending buy ticket when lovely teacher miss riley play laura dern suggest enter finding national science fair know exactly be go win joy film be little detail example homer be clearly strong student class have strength whatsoever be undeterring vision good organizer mean have lose reputation associate nerdi kid school know more rocket science do mean father forbid shoot rocket company property that is entire coal mining town walk mile way just set rocket fail fail fail fail again homer dad be play chris cooper favorite actor mine _ lone star here play antithesis character play _ matewan _ instead organize union rally be head coal miner be constantly wring hand union be be great unnoticed performance year note how multi - dimensional character be be son last nemesis most likely interfere son + dream truly love son want see succeed only way know how coal mining character see how far + ve come revolution modern technology have allow see society advance rate far fast generation don t understand be generation industrial revolution know other way raise family paradigm be shift father foot know other life so _ october sky _ far be merely feel good inspirational film offer much food thought be good type inspirational film one take btw final image film be just simple be as strong contrast aforementioned horizontal move white dot night sky background commonplace image be sure have be breathtake year ago
17,"carry on at your convenience is all about the goings - on in the factory of a toilet manufacturer , wc boggs ( kenneth williams ) . once they have won an order to manufacture 1000 bidets in two months and charles coote ( charles hawtrey ) has designed a suitable model , the factory employees set to work but are interrupted by union representative vic spanner ( kenneth cope ) and friend bernie hulke ( bernard bresslaw ) who call them out on strikes on the slightest pretext . meanwhile , chief foreman sid plummer ( sid james ) is growing tired of his wife beattie ( hattie jacques ) and her budgie . he would much rather live next door with fellow boggs worker chloe moore ( joan sims ) but once he discovers that the budgie can predict the winners of horse races , he is over the moon and flush with money . his daughter , myrtle plummer ( jacki piper ) , is going out with wc ' s son lewis boggs ( richard o ' callaghan ) and this causes conflict on the staff day out to the seaside when vic spanner vies for her attentions . in the end , if the strike does not cease , boggs will have to close down his factory , but the support of a group of women led by coote ' s wife -

up son , patsy rowlands is funny as miss withering , bogg ' s assistant , and renee houston is terrific in her small part as agatha . however , sole acting honours go to hattie jacques as beattie plummer . although her character is not directly involved with the main storyline , she manages to input a great deal of pathos and feeling into her character . a marvellous performance from a marvellous actress . the film suffers from annoying performances by bernard bresslaw and especially kenneth cope . in his carry on debut , cope overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as to be unfunny . joan sims returns as the love interest ( instead of barbara windsor ) . sims ' ' usual ' part as the downtrodden wife was taken by hattie jacques . additionally , bill maynard as fred moore is very poor . this carry on movie tries it best to entertain the viewer : - the locations and wealth of characters are appealing . however , the toilet humour becomes tiresome very quickly and some of the performances leave a lot to be desired . this movie does not know where it is going . it was made in 1971 and talbot rothwell the scriptwriter seems to be in two minds whether to go for ' bluer ' jokes or to maintain the ' innocent ' jokes success of most of its predecessors . that is why this film suffers . a minor carry on film whose major asset is the performance by hattie jacques . the new ' minor -

18,"at the outset of swordfish , john travolta ' s gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . swordfish is loud , violent and amoral . it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . and how does travolta ' s gabriel plan to do this ? by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out - terrorize terrorists . swordfish is a very cynical movie . it relies on an audience ' s perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non - human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . the movie ' s plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you ' d actually see how ridiculous it all is . this is a live - action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it ' s over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government ' s computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti - terrorist campaign . talk about whacked - out patriotism . my objections to swordfish are many . the body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort . it ' s becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits . another example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10 - year - old daughter and his ex - wife . stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband ' s adult films . thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel ' s henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley ' s daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films . there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on - screen victims as well . yea , it ' s only make believe , but that doesn ' t mean you have to tolerate it . travolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near - crazy gabriel . his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face / off . jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel ' s assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger - than - life character in gabriel . viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . and maybe that is the movie ' s underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive . and that is not enough . this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water .",neg,outset swordfish john travolta gabriel shear be pontificate status american cinema today basically say boil lack imagination majority writer how ironic travolta seem be describe late venture swordfish be loud violent amoral have audacity justify murder mayhem name sustain way life how do travolta gabriel plan do rob billion own government use fund out terrorize terrorist swordfish be very cynical movie rely audience perception leader ineffectual duplicitous terrorist non - human faceless entity worthy compassion consideration movie plot be preposterous enough illogical leap film ever slow d actually see how ridiculous be be live action road runner cartoon move so quickly ' s over catch breath ask reasonable question storyline revolve super hacker stanley jobson hugh jackman recruit gabriel crack government s computer code gabriel gather billion anti - terrorist campaign talk whack patriotism objection swordfish be many body count be high be expect movie sort ' s become bore watch anonymous soldier police officer government agent blow bit example be family dynamic stanley year old daughter ex - wife stanley have serve time prison hacking be show love caring father forbid ex see little girl audience animosity be immediately create former spouse show drinker smoker also sometimes star new husband adult film thus when be find murder late movie stanley daughter be allow time grieve fact subconsciously many audience be probably glad be kill then be sequence involve gabriel henchman hold gun head stanley daughter coerce hacker download key computer program gabriel child pawn have become most unwelcome clich recent film be enough violence real world involve child have make screen victim as well ' s only make believe doesn t mean have tolerate travolta be cool deadly charming flamboyant near crazy gabriel character be reminiscent villainous characterization broken arrow face jackman look dour most proceeding only moment depth come when finally be able create worm get government database sense joy accomplishment be computer whiz appreciate halle berry be decorative lovely gabriel assistant don cheadle be give little do head fbi agent hunt gabriel swordfish play comic book large life character gabriel viewer align uncertainty be hero villain maybe be movie underlie flaw be real hero speak only do upmost survive be enough be swordfish have be throw back water
19,"one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles . he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star . after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us - mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film . unfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for . we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do . then the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is . the plot of men with guns can be summarized "" in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas . dr . fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went . and he found out again and again and again . "" of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell . a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians . but the film talks down to the viewer . dr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country . he has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios . fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service . then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy . in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others . the student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be . fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general . the results are little different than one would expect . dr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive . even some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains . but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was . sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians . the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences . federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos . damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter . mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer .",neg,most respected name american independent filmmaking be john sayle have build strong reputation film matewan secret roan inish good be last film lone star sayle give complex unconventional look ethnic tension us mexico border expectation run high next film unfortunately man gun be film be hope be essentially tell first reel where film be go go be go do then film do exactly promise painful be plot man gun be summarize central south american country thing be really bad mountain where army clash guerrilla fuente do believe how bad thing be so go find again again again course be perfectly true many place region armed conflict have turn life live hell guerrilla war be always bad civilian film talk viewer fuente play federico luppi teach medicine capital city country have great humanitarian gesture train inspire good student go mountain make world little well poor indio fuente believe student be up there do humanitarian service then discover good student have instead return city run squalid private pharmacy shame disappointment fuente ask student have happen other student tell other be still mountain suggest be good place be fuente go find visit doctor ignore advice family patient happen be army general result be little different expect fuente start incredibly naive even american tourist present film mostly comic relief seem know well dr fuente thing have get pretty bad mountain fuente have go scene barbarity discover how wrong be sayle certainly have use minute screen time tell more profound nasty thing be happen down there most bad happen unarmed civilian cast be mostly unknown american audience federico luppi be good mexican actor play antique dealer tear mysterious force crono damian delgado make late appearance army deserter mandy patinkin have small role make look big trailer
20,"you don ' t look at a ren ? magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning . you likewise don ' t look at one for 88 minutes straight . surrealist works are notable for their quirks , and they are fun , but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting . that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died , a surrealistic , hyperactive comedy with no dialogue . it ' s not a silent movie ; there is lots of atmospheric music , occasional screams and weird sound effects , but nobody ever utters an audible word . though the film is distinctive , its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes , and as it progressed , watching became a chore . the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo - legendary ed wood , the man behind such "" classics "" as plan 9 > from outer space and night of the ghouls . the joke , of course , is that his films are so bad , they ' re good ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits . i woke up early the day i died , unfortunatly , is so bad that it ' s really bad . it stars billy zane ( titanic ) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse , escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around , stealing a car , clothes , and a load of money . our thief reaches a cemetery , where he witnesses a bizarre ritual . he falls asleep and finds himself , literally , in a hole , with his money gone . for whatever reason , he is bent on getting his hard - unearned cash back ( considering how easily he stole it the first time , why didn ' t he just go steal some more ? ) . he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don ' t have what he is looking for . i don ' t think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short . the subject and the style seem to have been made for it . unfortunately , twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length , and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome . it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on , up to the point where halfway through i was already weary . it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious ; but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is . i woke up early the day i died is a comedy , i guess , though it could have fooled me . unlike most ed wood films , this one tries to be funny and fails , instead of the other way around . there ' s nothing inherently wrong with that , in fact , i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so "" good "" at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one . whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we ' ll never know , but in either case , this is a failure . jonathan taylor thomas , christina ricci , summer phoenix , john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos . ricci , for example , plays a prostitute . her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out . thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff . was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work ? zane , meanwhile , occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up . lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature . the carnival side - show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no - budget production . it ' s desperately unfunny , but thinks it ' s the funniest thing since plan 9 ; , it ' s so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction . i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting send - off . ?

21,"the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches , and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? where else would pure escapism , a vulnerable hero , the "" talking villains , "" blatant product placement , predictable action sequences , and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ? i don ' t understand it myself , but that ' s what the bond series is based on . for ( i think ) 18 films , we ' ve mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films ) . but even i , a king of cynicism , can ' t bitch about it . and "" tomorrow never dies , "" the ( again , i think ) eighteenth bond film , and second brosnan bond film , is no exception . thank god ! the plot , as in most of them , is pure balderdash , but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it . instead of just plain billionaire psychotics , we get a rupert murdoch - esque media mogul / psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce , looking bitching with a white - haired cru cut , and always talking like he ' s out of breath ) , who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war . no , this is not "" wag the dog "" - he wants a real war , between china and england , and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it . . . in comes bond . james is sent all around the world , trying to do research on carver , fighting with his men , and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh , asian action star extraordinaire . . . and co - star of "" supercop , "" nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one ) . the two eventually , and predictably of course , begin working together , and yes , there is some sexual tension between the two . luckily , their relationship is never strained , and she never gives into his cassanova - ness until the finale . thank god again . in every bond film , james bags , on average , three women ( sometimes more , sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids - cautionary dalton ) , and he doesn ' t spoil this one ( though we never see them , of course - i mean , they need to stay around a pg - 13 rating ) . there ' s always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again , the big bond girl ( yeoh ) , and this time we have an almost - cameo by teri hatcher as carver ' s wife , paris , who , it seems , was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning . yes , teri ' s very attractive , but she seems kind of dull . of course , it ' s not really her fault ; her part is under - written , and she ' s only in a small part of it . oh well . and there are always the big henchmen , the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains . this time we get a tall , arian - looking ( not to mention robert shaw in "" from russia with love "" - looking ) guy named stamper ( goetz otto ) , who is pretty awesome , although a bit stiff ( well , mostly his posture , really ) . and for a bit of comedy , we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point . the government people have small parts , as usual , with q ( desmond llewelyn , looking near death , sadly ) getting only one scene ( in a more grouchy mood than usual ) , and m ( judi dench ) , getting more than m usually gets ( i mean , it is judi dench ) . and for no reason whatsoever , except ' cause he was so good in "" goldeneye , "" joe don baker shows up again as wade , admitting he has no reason for being there , and is this time more annoying . again , oh well . the action sequences are not a let - down , although sometimes go on too long . they pop up every now and then , mainly because they have to ( for the sake of the series ) , and some significant ones are the opening one , one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control , and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle , nonetheless ) through china streets ( or was it vietnam . . . the plot ' s not really essential ) . they ' re more high - tech , and feature much more laughs , which , yeah , i dig . so what if they ' re distracting ; they ' re supposed to be !

22,"the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it ' s adequately explained by the commercials . with 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty - tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal . deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a "" pageant "" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero . and if there wasn ' t anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second - rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington . ( a heist comedy ? yup . deniro and hoffman are "" stealing "" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) wag the dog succeeds because it ' s based one great truth : the american people are stupid . ok , maybe it ' s not "" love thy neighbor as thyself "" or even "" two plus two makes four "" , but a truth nonetheless .

( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don ' t .",pos,premise wag dog be so simple ' s adequately explain commercial day go election president never see call political dirty trick artist robert deniro distract attention burgeon sex scandal deniro enlist hollywood producer dustin hoffman produce pageant phony war albania fight blue screen hollywood record studio nashville woody harrelson reluctant psychotic hero wasn t more movie be second rate heist comedy at good enliven great actor sneaker go washington heist comedy deniro hoffman be steal election so speak movie be more how do fun have do else wag dog succeed ' base great truth american people be stupid maybe ' s love neighbor even make truth nonetheless average person think ' re really smart thing movie satirize moviemaking political process be invite challenge spend week watch movie actually be make hour straight watch c span when house be session ' re so utterly predictably stupid hollywood know certain percentage go see hard rain magoo washington know win t notice few dollar spend here there porno art grant cigar subsidy deniro character know american geography skill be so weak win t be able locate albania map beauty wag dog be isn t light meaningless comedy politic speechless michael keaton geena davis picture level light hearted politcal satire greatness be hard edge cynical look manner morally deprive ethically challenge baby boomer connive sleazy way white house primary color be little disappointed way last election turn thank ask instead david mamet script strike delicate balance comedy cynicism need satire do keep fantasy world where most schemer scheme come beautifully fail only entertaining humorous fashion deniro be play variation al capone character untouchable violent rage ' s do love be bring joy baseball savage bloody beating bat threaten lot people mind ' do very nice polite way ' s very mellow restrained performance fit air gamesmanship script hoffman other hand be giddy exuberant joyous kind thing be character live ' s so excited ' t even shut even edge disaster ' bright eyed oddly tint sunglass positive insider note ' base character powerful anonymous producer be true hoffman still exude kind let put show electricity figure producer need have good part most frustrating part wag dog be support cast character be so well draw so well act want see more listen talk wise mamet dialogue get know well don t anne heche be dead bang portrayal political press aide cool compose outside panicked frenzied outside denis leary favorite actor see ref be fad king handle profitable back end t shirt tie in shoe contract other creative innovative way separate fool money make whole movie just fad king ' go see willie nelson merle haggard handle musical end thing fabulously upbeat gospel chorus theme song weepy country waltz hilarious ballad green beret parody woody harrelson have brief memorable part overmedicated hero albanian conflict craig t nelson opposition candidate ever reliable william h macy wacky cia agent be give surprisingly short shrift small gripe be never see spin doctor other side be do wag dog be funny movie serious problem trivialization american politic role press dumbe issue impact hollywood create campaign commercial reduction thing political soundbite sidebar list go solve most problem take great role national life educate voter citizen wag dog remind happen don t

"" how do get back to earth ? "" is the question that infests the rest of this sci - fi epic . critique : this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element ( 6 . 5 / 10 ) from the summer of 1997 . it ' s a film with a lot of flash , but very little actual substance . admittedly , there isn ' t an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film , but this film does run a little too long , and did lose me in regards to its complex time - travel / multi - dimensional story line . having said that , the special effects in this movie were amazing , and the overall look and feel were also way above average . you really felt like you were in the future , and riding through space with these poor souls . unfortunately for this chosen family , their 10 - year old son is the smartest one in the group , and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family ( ever heard that one before ? yawn ! ) . the acting is ok , and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend ' s matt leblanc who shows us all that he ' s definitely more than just a pretty face . on the down side , the family riff - raff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and time - consuming ( even though we gotta give them credit for "" trying "" to develop characters in a sci - fi pic ) , the story line is hard to follow , the evil character in the movie actually tells people that he ' s "" evil "" , and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long . on the slick side , many of the special effects are really cool ( the sequence in which the family is "" paralyzed "" during the hyper - drive is awesome , and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool ) , the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming , and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling ( i will also admit that "" somehow "" they got me to semi - tear up near the conclusion of this picture . . . . very odd . . . . . ) . overall , if you ' re a big sci - fi fan , check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative , and if you ' re not , i would still suggest seeing this movie , but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts . little known facts : this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic ( 7 / 10 ) out of the top spot at the box - office after 15 straight weeks at number one . garry oldman is british , and was once married to uma thurman for about six months . mimi rogers was tom cruise ' s first wife .",pos,film be base campy tv show s same appellation mind most people include your truly see movie have see episode original series movie be really stand alone regard family robinson lose space plot set year family robinson be choose sail space search other planet contain natural resource earth need order survive future colonization process be join able pilot west leblanc evil uninvited stowaway oldman do want see trip conclude successful tip eventually trek go awry be lose space how do get back earth be question infest rest sci fi epic critique film remind lot fifth element summer ' s film lot flash very little actual substance admittedly isn t annoying character chris tucker other film film do run little too long do lose regard complex time travel multi - dimensional story line have say special effect movie be amazing overall look feel be also way average really feel be future ride space poor soul unfortunately choose family year old son be smart group father be too wrap work notice rest family ever hear before acting be ok be especially surprised solid performance tv friend s matt leblanc show ' s definitely more just pretty face down side family riff raff cut most picture be lame time consume even get give credit try develop character sci fi pic story line be hard follow evil character movie actually tell people ' evil movie go about minute too long slick side many special effect be really cool sequence family be paralyzed hyper drive be awesome animate monkey join family halfway flic be mucho cool credit presentation end film be slamming adventure fall be somewhat thrilling also admit somehow get semi - tear conclusion picture very odd overall ' re big sci fi fan check movie special effect challenge narrative ' re still suggest see movie then probably wait come video forward boring part little know fact film always be remember movie knock titanic top spot box office straight week number garry oldman be british be once married uma thurman about month mimi roger be tom cruise first wife
25,"when i ponder childhood memories past , one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the "" inspector gadget "" tv show with my older brother . truth be told , we were rabid fanatics ; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune , alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr . claw , the inspector ' s arch nemesis . i was never a biggie on nostalgia , but you just can ' t help but have fond memories of something like that . sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re - runs of my favorite episodes , trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid . at the very least , i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me . despite how horrid a film may be , the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up . so back i sat , with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver ( let ' s face it ; exactly how good can a live - action disney film really be ? ) . i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr . magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations ) , and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well . rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness . as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind , i was left sitting there , absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen . can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world ? right from the beginning , i knew i was in trouble . in the opening scenes , each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be , to simply serve as real - life duplicates of their cartoon clones . when referring to them , people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be ( "" oh , hi penny ! is brain with you ?

26,"it ' s been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci - fi opus ` mission to mars ' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar . why ? the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel - good science fiction drama more akin to ` 2001 : a space odyssey ' . i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie - going patrons were expecting another ` armageddon ' . but no , ` mission to mars ' certainly isn ' t one large action sequence about colossal disaster . this is a supposedly thoughtful , family - friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel . you have been warned . of course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see ` apollo 13 ' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation . brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off . when he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like ` the untouchables ' or ` mission : impossible ' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally ) . of course , there ' s also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including ` snake eyes ' and the notorious bomb ` the bonfire of the vanities ' ) . . . . all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood . that term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is ` mission to mars ' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient . if i were gary sinise , i wouldn ' t touch de palma with a 10 - foot pole . sinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in ` snake eyes ' and this vomit - inducing sham , i ' m sure he wouldn ' t want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration . the academy award - winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 ) . after a barbecue get - together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet . suddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a ` sand tornado ' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction . for some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art . the team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive . immediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o ' connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars . let ' s put the ` secret ' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there . it is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months . i ' m not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind ` m2m ' didn ' t capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia . instead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship . what happened during the five months prior to this ? did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ? still , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time - frame involving a fuel leak . depalma ' s direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ? c ' mon ) . there ' s a few good , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud . it ' s a colossal bummer that ` mission to mars ' is poorly assembled and laughably written , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists . as mentioned before , anyone looking for some disaster - movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed . . . maybe even cheated . after the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words ? the end ' somehow adding insult to injury ) , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen . others muttered obscenities , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling ` jeez , that sucked . ' okay , it did suck . but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy . . . after all , they do pretty well . sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes , robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple , and funnyman o ' connell - well , he has a couple lines are actually amusing ( and intentionally so ) . the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive . so , by golly , where did this ` mission ' go wrong ? looking back on the appalling experience , i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have . while watching ` mission to mars ' , my suggestion would be to immediately abort , or better yet , don ' t even strap yourself in for lift - off .",neg,' be hour return much anticipate sci fi opus mission mar still detect reek moldy cheddar why movie be shoddy cheesefest full digital eye candy staple carelessly flimsy screenplay somehow manage leapfrog great promise space opera instead shoot angle feel good science fiction drama more akin space odyssey get feeling most fellow movie go patron be expect armageddon mission mar certainly t large action sequence colossal disaster be supposedly thoughtful family friendly space flick apocalyptic excitement take back seat visual elegance uplifting drivel have be warn course craft tightly claustrophobic space drama be impossible see apollo excellent example few director possess skill craftsmanship pull seriously scar reputation brian de palma have enough directorial expertise visual wizardry sleeve pull when get hand intelligent systematically practical script untouchable mission impossible director have ability create sound technical achievement overly indulgent style become bothersome more occasionally course s also inexcusable string crap have carry name include snake eye notorious bomb bonfire vanity make want call palma most talented hack hollywood term be too harsh be judge solely perpetual waste talent be mission mar choice word have be slightly less lenient be gary sinise wouldn t touch de palma foot pole sinise be wonderful wonderful actor appear snake eye vomit induce sham ' m sure wouldn t want risk embarrassment third collaboration academy award winner play nasa astronaut jim mcconnell man recently lose wife kim delaney be apparently psychologically unfit upcoming space shuttle mission mar forget mention year barbecue get together astronaut cut luc goddard don cheadle team be already take measurement calculation red planet suddenly tower formation rock soil probably well dub sand tornado appear create whirlwind suction reason astronaut just stand there calmly admire be lovely piece art team be kill second expect luc be able send final transmission still be alive immediately second mission consist astronaut mcconnell husband wife woody terri blake tim robbin connie nielsen phil ohlmyer jerry o connell be dispatch rescue luc discover mysterious secret planet mar let s put secret hold now discuss trip there be explain scientifically accurate probably trip mar take roughly month ' m sure why quartet screenwriter m2 m didn t capitalize juicy opportunity create tension claustrophobia instead join team final day ship happen month prior do just play card tell dirty joke still be few nicely tense moment maybe only movie time frame involve fuel leak depalma direction be quite good scene score ennio morricone be largely inconsistent organ music space mon ' s few good imaginative idea landslide cheese sad realization cause sigh loud ' s colossal bummer mission mar be poorly assemble laughably write dubious supremely silly finale only satisfy dedicated optimist mention before look disaster movie carnage be go feel savagely disappointed maybe even cheat unbelievably hokey final shot word end somehow add insult injury few audience member make effort boo his screen other mutter obscenity shake head disbelief mumble jeez suck do suck have show actor sympathetic mercy after all do pretty well sinise be sincere effective many scene robbin nielsen wholeheartedly convince love nasa couple funnyman o connell have couple line be actually amusing intentionally so digital effect accompany sand tornado sequence be quite impressive so golly where do mission go wrong look back appalling experience say practically conduit crevasse have watch mission mar suggestion be immediately abort well yet don t even strap lift off

28,"blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood ' s premier leading men . blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it . it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well . although , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . the ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story . but at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once . that really doesn ' t take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit . blade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire . his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire . including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust . blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother . but this isn ' t as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade ' s world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films . the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires . where do vampires get money ? well , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations . i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie . blade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community . he isn ' t content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority . he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all - powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable . it ' s up to blade to see that this doesn ' t transpire . admittedly , blade is style over substance through and through . the story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less . the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type . this isn ' t a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this . the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise . it ' s a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise . blade ' s production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster . the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done . although , the mtv - style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences . blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre . this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle . what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life . very cool .",pos,blade be movie show wesley snipe really live potential hollywood premier lead man blade be base comic book character same name have comic book kind of feel be very stylish movie most part style work very well few point think be watch music video oppose movie idea blade be good be basic plot story time thing seem get bit muddle writer appear want do too many thing once really doesn t take away story too much do hurt little bit blade snipe be half man half vampire mother be bite vampire when be pregnant result have many classic trait vampire include thirst human blood be keep control special serum quench blood lust blade have spend life hunt kill vampire sort revenge fact kind kill mother isn t as easy seem vampire blade world be more sophisticated one find most film government other authority know existence vampire let feast population large be take bribe vampire where do vampire get money blade run multinational company order finance vampire organization personally think whole secret corporate world run vampire be very clever idea great addition movie blade run evil deacon frost stephen dorff maverick vampire community isn t content live human be convince vampire race be superior mean insure superiority have manage translate ancient vampire scroll tell method make all powerful vampire render virtually unstoppable ' s blade see doesn t transpire admittedly blade be style substance through story be relatively forgettable one be fun none less acting blade be just expect movie type isn t film be go win accolade performance actor know movie be play fun seem think otherwise ' s popcorn movie one involve have illusion otherwise blade s production value be as slick find typical summer blockbuster combat sequence blade vampire target be incredibly well do mtv style cut do get nerve while long sequence blade be fun movie interesting take vampire genre be movie like vampire tuxedo live coffin basement gothic castle blade excel be bring classic lore vampire next century fresh outlook life very cool
29,"the working title for no looking back was long time , nothing new , and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture . even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes , it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics . writer / director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline , the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn ' t spent their life in seclusion . instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings , burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion , offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way . no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful . the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide , and the sooner , the better . alas , that ' s not the case , and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio . and , to further depress audiences , burns has shot the entire film on cold , rainy days in a gray new york state beach town . peeks of sunshine are few and far between . no wonder the characters are all so miserable . first of all , we have charlie ( burns ) , a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion , then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home . that girlfriend is claudia ( lauren holly ) , and , after picking up the pieces of her life following charlie ' s departure , she has moved on , shacking up with one of charlie ' s old school buddies , mike ( jon bon jovi ) . the two have a comfortable relationship , but it ' s apparent to even a blind person that they ' re not right for each other . claudia years for some spice in her life ; mike wants to settle down and have children . then charlie re - enters the mix . so who , if anyone , will claudia end up with ? who cares ? ? no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we ' re not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle . so what if no one finds happiness -- these characters don ' t deserve it anyway , especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time . they aren ' t real people -- they ' re a writer ' s construct stumbling through a too - obvious storyline . they should know the ending as well as we do . and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two . another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially - interesting supporting characters . blythe danner is solid as claudia ' s housebound mother , connie britton is suitably high - strung as claudia ' s neurotic sister , and jennifer esposito is eye - catching as a bartender in search of a little romance . sadly , all we get is quick glimpses into their lives , although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell . none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes . edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here . jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career , but he could still use a little polish . the worst case is lauren holly , who presents a completely bland claudia . as portrayed here , she ' s hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moment ' s interest , not to mention undying love . burns ' ex , the monumentally untalented maxine bahns , would have been hard - pressed to do a less inspired job . when he released the brothers mcmullen , edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival ( robert redford has apparently stuck with him -- the aging actor / director executive produced this mess ) . two films and three short years later , the luster has faded . some movie makers have only one good film in them . with back -

30,"you ' ve heard all the hype . you ' ve seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler ' s list ) as qui - gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi - wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker . if you ' ve read any reviews , you ' ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy . you also may have heard that this one ' s too kiddie - friendly , and doesn ' t have enough content for adults . believe the hype . the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala ' s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . but there ' s something missing here , and it isn ' t budget or effects - it ' s everything money * can ' t * buy . the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad - stroked and flat characters . the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui - gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi - wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence . he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out . portman ' s queen amidala and mcgregor ' s obi - wan kenobi don ' t fare nearly so well . amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . and obi - wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he ' s nothing but a robin to qui - gon jinn ' s batman . however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . he also absolutely nails alec guiness ' ( obi - wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that ' s one of the problems with this film . i would never call myself a "" star wars "" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i ' ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn ' t * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn ' t bother to brush - up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . for example , one of the film ' s main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . for those of you not recently steeped in "" star wars "" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader ' s master in "" return of the jedi "" and "" empire strikes back . "" so , obviously , his appearance in "" phantom menace "" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . a lot of the movie is like that . r2 - d2 and c - 3po make token appearances , and it ' s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience ' s pre - existing fondness for them . . . because he doesn ' t do much to add to it in any way . same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn ' t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from "" empire strikes back "" ) , and alderaan ( leia ' s home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in "" star wars "" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . what ' s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . there ' s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . unlike chewbacca and c - 3po , who got their humanity ( if you ' ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive "" teenage mutant ninja turtles . "" furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . oddly , this isn ' t just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . well , he ' s done a good job . the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight - year - old boy . that ' s not jake lloyd ' s fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . that ' s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin ' s future evil in the film . the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there ' s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english - language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn ' t all hearts and roses is yoda ' s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui - gon jinn . his explanation ? "" his future is clouded . "" ( warning : major spoiler ahead . enter at your own risk . ) of course , the noble qui - gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary - looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double - sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . because qui - gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi - wan , qui - gon ' s young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi - wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin "" darth vader "" skywalker . did this story need to be told ? i would say no . but is it a worthwhile movie to see ? absolutely . if you don ' t enter the theater with jedi - size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . and yoda and young obi - wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . above all , this is a fun movie . not deep , not meaningful , and not profound . but fun . maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co - write the script , and the guy who directed "" empire "" will direct . because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . : )",pos,' ve hear hype ' ve see face natalie portman professional queen amidala liam neeson schindler s list qui gon jinn ewan mcgregor trainspotte obi wan kenobi jake lloyd jingle way young anakin skywalker ' ve read review ' ve also probably hear movie fail live magic humanity first trilogy also have hear one too kiddie friendly doesn t have enough content adult believe hype effect be stunning digitalize creature be amazingly realistic lightsaber duel be amazing queen amidala sumptuous robe be fit be wear queen elizabeth ' miss here isn t budget effect s money buy actor struggle as well flesh broad stroke flat character most successful be liam neeson qui gon jinn jedi master young obi wan kenobi have quiet dignity wise command presence be anchor movie be character george lucas apparently spend time flesh portman queen amidala mcgregor obi wan kenobi don t fare nearly so well amidala future mother luke leia queen peaceful planet be invade trade federation come stoic stilte caricature appear be vulcan geisha former life obi wan mcgregor make very endearing have so little screen time ' s robin qui gon jinn s batman however mcgregor do struggle manfully infuse surprisingly small support role spark genuine insight humanity do good job also absolutely nail alec guiness obi wan episode scottish accent really make presence film more profound have be otherwise fact luca seem bank preexist knowledge quite bit s problem film never call star war fan especially consider mean be fanatic day ' ve always enjoy film else america however be person america * hasn t see film at all even recently doesn t bother brush up name obscure character be hopelessly lose example film main nefarious character be senator palpatine recently steep star war trivium emperor palpatine be scary hooded apparition be darth vader master return jedi empire strike back so obviously appearance phantom menace be mean stir echo later role series thus make role here more meaningful lot movie be r2 d2 3po make token appearance ' obvious lucas be bank audience pre -

32,"the ads for "" batman and robin "" scream "" the event of the summer is here "" and that ' s the problem . the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . "" batman and robin "" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . it ' s like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun . it wasn ' t always this way . tim burton ' s "" batman "" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . the film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . batman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . the joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city ' s breathtaking gothic skyline . those days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . "" batman and robin "" has far more in common with the campy 60 ' s batman tv show than with tim burton ' s tale of darkness . the blame lies with director joel schumacher . a former window - dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . unfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn ' t the faintest notion of what to do . "" batman and robin "" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it ' s often difficult to tell who ' s whacking who . while the characters flail at each other , one - liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . "" batman and robin "" doesn ' t merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions . it ' s rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . ironically , the parts of "" batman and robin "" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . easily the best batman yet , clooney ' s expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn ' t even hint at . the film ' s most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne ' s butler and surrogate father . as for the other heroes , chris o ' donnell ' s robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . in a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne ' s girlfriend is puzzling . i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built - in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . of course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that ' s where "" batman and robin "" really suffers . as mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . laboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he ' s having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it ' s apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s / he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . once thurman transforms into the eco - psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . thurman fails to maintain the character ' s maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . the biggest lesson to be learned from "" batman and robin "" is that more is not better . joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . i don ' t think so . my prescription ? fire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist ' s convention so he ' ll understand that there ' s no hard feelings ) . give alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o ' donnell and michael gough . call jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman . then , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the "" event "" mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time .",neg,ad batman robin scream event summer be here s problem producer be apparently so intent create spectacle forget put actual movie inside batman robin be minute lavish set flashy costume big confusing fight scene barely hint substance ' s cheesy king island stage show bright busy visually divert very much fun wasn t always way tim burton batman be epic story obsession duality darkness revenge film far perfect be striking mood piece otherworldly feel batman be creepy brood creature night joker brilliantly overplay jack nicholson be once charismatic repellent batman joker be opposite side same coin battle inner demon gotham city breathtake gothic skyline day dark knight be go replace psychedelic ice capade run amuck batman robin have far more common campy batman tv show tim burton tale darkness blame lie director joel schumacher former window dresser schumacher be adept decorate set dress people exotic costume unfortunately when come time have people walk talk hasn t faint notion do batman robin be overstuff intricately choreographed fight scene so poorly edit ' s often difficult tell whack character flail other liner bad pun be toss confetti few carefully place joke set action movie sailing too many wisecrack undermine momentum film batman robin doesn t merely lose momentum stall completely several occasion ' rare see action flick as sluggish one ironically part batman robin work be one show character street clothing most succeed george clooney bruce wayne easily good batman yet clooney expressive eye weary smile give character sense depth script doesn t even hint film most effective scene be tender quiet exchange clooney alfre michael gough bruce wayne butler surrogate father other hero chris o donnell robin be enthusiastic perky horny hell pudgy alicia silverstone be hard accept athlete debut batgirl movie fill brim major character decision add entirely unnecessary batgirl elle macpherson bruce wayne girlfriend be puzzle suspect producer insert woman attempt convince audience guy run around rubber suit build nipple shapely buttock huge codpiece be actually straight course real star batman film be villain s where batman robin really suffer mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger give bad performance year spit stream lame catch phrase wooden fashion labor ton appliance schwarzenegger look ' s have trouble even move suit let alone try act thurman fare somewhat well poison ivy overact terribly early establish scene character ' s apparently rule batman series person become villain s be cartoonish bumble nerd once thurman transform eco psychotic poison ivy do nice mae west impersonation classic vamp seduce man breath kill kiss thurman fail maintain character maniacal sense style though end merely sputter way latter scene film big lesson be learn batman robin be more be well joel schumacher fill screen eye candy technicolor overkill merely emphasize trifle film really be critic suggest batman series have run steam don t think so prescription fire joel schumacher offer ticket rubber fetishist convention ' understand s hard feeling give alicia silverstone walking paper keep clooney o donnell michael gough call jack nicholson michelle pfieffer beg reprise role joker catwoman then ditch campiness love pete lose event mentality make movie instead spectacle next time

34,"if anything , "" stigmata "" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly - themed films relatively close to one another . of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst . i suppose i should have seen this coming . after all , "" blair witch "" thoroughly creeped me out , "" sixth sense "" was mildly spooky , and then "" stir of echoes "" had its moments , but wasn ' t anything i ' d lose sleep over . clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping . is it then any surprise that "" stigmata "" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv - influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? no , not really . patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe - trotting mother . as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently - deceased brazilian priest . the priest ' s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue . father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue . his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ . father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie ' s story , considering she ' s an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on . he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church . as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a "" fifth gospel "" before they were excommunicated . the new rupert wainwright music video . . . i mean film "" stigmata "" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse . indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it ' s only interesting for about five minutes . i ' m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow - motion , double - exposure , and extreme close - ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school . his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache - inducing . what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , "" see ? look at what i can do ! i ' m an ex - cellent dir - ect - or . "" maybe then he ' d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow - motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) . if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn ' t see it . just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double - exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever . arrrrrrrghhhh . . . then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn ' t bother me if "" stigmata "" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging . though wainwright ' s vanity certainly doesn ' t help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script . where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren ' t given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her . the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard - working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she ' s kind of cute , so let ' s start the bleeding ! the fact that she ' s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn ' t help , either . according to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? go clubbing ! sure , that makes sense . arquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one - dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . even though frankie page ' s life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . even more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . father andrew ' s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . as for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , "" i ' ll get you , my pretty , "" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . trust me , i ' m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . what ' s worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . first of all , the film doesn ' t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? how come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? actually , i ' m not sure what frankie was posessed by . supposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . which one is it ? the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . furthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap - up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . if you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you ' ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . there ' s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . "" stigmata ' s "" religion is so off - base that it can ' t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all - out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . i ' m not catholic ; in fact , i don ' t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . it ' s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as "" stigmata "" does . it ' s not thought - provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . i ' m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . maybe it ' s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . like so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . so much is overdone in "" stigmata , "" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film ' s ( many ) flaws . i ' m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth - shattering . when we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five - year - old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and "" stigmata "" is it .",neg,stigmata be take warning release similarly theme film relatively close supernatural horror flick release year be clearly bad suppose have see come after all blair witch thoroughly creep sixth sense be mildly spooky then stir echo have moment wasn t ' lose sleep over clearly quality horror summer have slowly be drop be then surprise stigmata be dull most horribly execute piece mtv influence tripe have see long while really patricia arquette play frankie page hairdresser pittsburgh receive rosary gift globe trot mother turn rosary belong recently deceased brazilian priest priest church have be investigation father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne mysterious appearance bleed statue father kiernan be investigator have make career disprove suppose religious sign time believe be bleed statue investigation be soon call however when frankie start exhibit sign stigmata person be inflict wound jesus christ father kiernan be initially skeptical frankie story consider s atheist witness stigmata attack dedicate find be go eventually begin suspect boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce be conceal bring catholic church turn dead priest have be work translation fifth gospel be excommunicate new rupert wainwright music video mean film stigmata be sort film start ok only get bad indeed have be good be music video ' s only interesting about minute ' m sure wainwright be try prove endless parade slow motion double exposure extreme close up whoaaaaaa other fact have most swell head director hollywood have be film school camera trickery be interesting little while eventually become headache induce film need be second audio track be play dialogue such be wainwright scream audience see look do ' m ex -

35,"i think maybe it ' s time for the batman series to be put to rest . not only has the first two films ' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a "" superhero "" been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all - out camp with few traces of the self - mocking restraint of the relatively light - hearted third installment . let me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o ' donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond . mr . freeze ' s thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick - handles it through the museum . i might have expected this from an airplane - style farce , but i don ' t think that ' s what this movie is supposed to be . after all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero / action genre and kept the corny death - defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony . not any more ; the list goes on and on in this one . robin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 , 000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing in the door to save batman . mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond . a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he - man cartoons . my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her . not bad , but wouldn ' t the police ( or maybe batman ? ) notice if the road was on fire ? i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place , but . . . . it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment . as if three protagonists and two villains weren ' t enough , batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne ' s butler alfred ( michael gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it wasn ' t surrounded by so much silliness , as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce ' s girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie . all this might be semi - excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining , but it isn ' t . in fact , it ' s kind of boring . mr . freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson ' s joker and danny devito ' s penguin . their evil plot is as predictable ( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words , "" today gotham city , tomorrow the world ! "" ) as it is lame - brained ( didn ' t it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too ? ) . and robin ' s constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bull - headed and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place . strip away the stars , the fancy set design , and the status as a "" batman movie , "" and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick .",neg,think maybe ' time batman series be put rest only have first film unsettling insight really take make superhero be abandon one throw linger realism window go all out camp few trace self mock restraint relatively light hearted third installment let give example first scene movie batman george clooney robin chris o donnell be summon museum have be literally turn ice mr freeze arnold schwarzenegger attempt steal diamond mr freeze thug be arm none other hockey stick be problem hero automatic skate shoot shoe point robin manage get hold hockey stick grab diamond stick handle museum have expect airplane style farce don t think s movie be suppose be after all previous batman movie be actually fairly realistic standard superhero action genre keep corny death defy stunt minimum play obligatory cheesiness at least amount irony more list go on on one robin hold outside fly rocket ship foot high atmosphere climb door save batman mr freeze poison ivy uma thurman leap skyscraper survive land small pond world dominate mad scientist live fortress seem have be steal old he man cartoon very favorite example be scene batgirl alicia silverstone get race motorcycle thug come clever notion douse road gasoline set fire distract bad wouldn t police maybe batman notice road be fire know gotham city be crazy anarchic place also seem creator batman movie be obey unwritten rule have be more main character plot line successive installment protagonist villain weren t enough batman robin far weigh underdeveloped side story fail health bruce wayne butler alfre michael gough have seem poignant wasn t surround so much silliness as well several scene elle macpherson bruce girlfriend serve purpose other remind be movie be semi - excusable story be interesting entertaining isn t fact ' kind of boring mr freeze poison ivy pale comparison villain past baddie such jack nicholson joker danny devito penguin evil plot be as predictable schwarzenegger actually pronounce word today gotham city tomorrow world be lame brain t ever occur poison ivy freeze entire world kill precious plant too robin constant challenging batman mostly just make look bull headed stupid make wonder why batman ever have take partner first place strip away star fancy set design status batman movie have here be barely passable summer action flick
36,"the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films . one was _gattaca_ . the other was _the thirteenth floor_ . just as _gattaca_ was overshadowed by the mighty _titanic_ , _the thirteenth floor_ was relegated to obscurity by _the matrix_ . however , _the thirteeth floor_ , though it deals with similar themes , is a much better movie than the frenetic , childish and improbable _matrix_ . a cutting edge computer scientist , hannon fuller ( played by the charming armin mueller - stahl ) , is murdered . his associate , douglas hall , ( craig bierko ) apparently framed and suspected by the police , enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery . along the way a beautiful blonde ( gretchen mol ) , more bodies , and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture . _the thirteenth floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches , choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise . the result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view . first , its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline . second and more seriously , it demands that its audience think and feel . no wonder it fell through the cracks . done in film noir style as a murder mystery , this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels . many audiences will simply be bewildered by it , rather than engaged , which is a shame , because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment . i recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie . despite its philosophical challenges , _the thirteenth floor_ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller ( mol ) and douglas hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller . in that sense it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ , which , for all of its cute philosophical byplay , is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever . the moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying , wrenching and intellectually challenging . in its final moments the film even takes on itself , when david , jane ' s husband , who has come to enjoy killing , accuses her of being the sick one . although there is a victory for the leading characters , this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane , and thus a deep - seated character flaw . in fact , hannon fuller ' s activities in the simulated world , the behavior of jane ' s husband , and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters . this is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil . the tragedy is not in their stars , but in themselves . the major actors , all of whom are required to play two or even three roles , perform extremely well . bierko , who will be familiar as the psycho from _the long kiss goodnight_ , is outstanding . d ' onofrio as whitney , who plays a pivotal role in support , also turns in a good performance . the lovely gretchen mol , whose elegance , integrity , and determination suggest bergman in _casablanca_ , does a wonderful job . her voice , however , lacks the necessary weight at times . this could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script . some minor flaws , hairline cracks in fine porcelain , appear in places . there are one or two instances of jerky editing . the script takes the edge off the film ' s climaxes . the atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times ( yet , there is a clue there too ) . one wonders if even after two decades , _blade runner_ is still casting its long shadow over sci - fi films . one can see a group of suits in their suite , waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in _amadeus_ : "" make it more like_blade runner_ , you know , dark and rainy .

38,"before the remake of psycho appears , we ' ve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder . as usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars , and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing . the film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen ) ' having fun ' in an loft apartment . the problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) , who is not too happy when he discovers this affair . if i was paltrow , though , i ' d definitely go with mortensen . less wrinkles . anyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition : he ' ll pay him to kill his lovely wife . mortensen agrees , but the murder goes awry , and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses . unfortunately , the film dosen ' t progress very fast . in fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s - l - o - w . ) the plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts . not too good for a ' thriller . ' also , the performances , apart from douglas , are below par . paltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie . mortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role isn ' t meaty enough to show all his talent . which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is does . however , i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside . also popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective . again , it ' s not a character we ' re seeing on the screen , it ' s david suchet . the director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom - in ' s , quick cuts , etc . the lighting is also interesting . however , looks can ' t save this film from the depths of mediocre , and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway . the screenplay is o . k , but there ' s some hackneyed sub - plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched . the characters also make incredibly dumb moves , especially paltrow , and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel . with a combination of no tension , drama , or decent characters , a perfect murder is a failure all round , and an incredible disappointment . there are a few bright moments , but they are far and few between . the last thing a thriller should be is boring , and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas , you wouldn ' t be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder . overall rating = review by david wilcock ? 1998 "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes",neg,remake psycho appear ' ve get suffer remake early hitchcock film dial m murder usual hollywood have fill glitz big name star amount loud sound film open emily paltrow david viggo mortensen have fun loft apartment problem be paltrow be married stephen be too happy when discover affair be paltrow though ' definitely go mortensen less wrinkle anyhow stephen approach david interesting proposition pay kill lovely wife mortensen agree murder go awry twist keep come film progress unfortunately film dosen t progress very fast fact move tortoise arthritis read very very s l o w plot move nowhere fast only become exciting very short burst too good thriller also performance apart dougla be par paltrow show immense talent se7en slide door be strangely stilte even unconvincing movie mortensen be little bit well come young dougla role isn t meaty enough show talent leave dougla waltz away film be do however doubt dougla find very hard play stogie smoking drink womanizer creepy underside also pop film be david suchet play shifty looking detective again ' s character ' see screen ' david suchet director buy fugitive pile flash technique such zoom in s quick cut lighting be also interesting however look t save film depth mediocre film seem work well single set anyway screenplay be o s hackneyed sub - plot dougla be ruthless player wall street again ending be surprisingly stupid cliched character also make incredibly dumb move especially paltrow stephen appear lose intelligence last reel combination tension drama decent character perfect murder be failure round incredible disappointment be few bright moment be far few last thing thriller be be boring film just barely manage keep interest thank michael dougla wouldn t be miss decide watch perfect murder overall rating review david wilcock know kid norville barne

40,"plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . they get into an accident . one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . what ' s the deal ? watch the movie and "" sorta "" find out . . . critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn ' t snag this one correctly . they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ? well , its main problem is that it ' s simply too jumbled . it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what ' s going on . there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . now i personally don ' t mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film ' s biggest problem . it ' s obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? not really . the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half - way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn ' t the make the film all that more entertaining . i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! okay , we get it . . . there are people chasing her and we don ' t know who they are . do we really need to see it over and over again ? how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . there might ' ve been a pretty decent teen mind - fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess "" the suits "" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character ' s unraveling . overall , the film doesn ' t stick because it doesn ' t entertain , it ' s confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . oh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it ' s just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . whatever . . . skip it ! where ' s joblo coming from ?

43,""" flubber "" is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation , and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney . it ' s the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids , but anyone else will feel left out as it ' s boring , slow , and incredibly lifeless . what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water , and it ' s a shame because it could have been a great film . hypothetically , i mean . "" flubber , "" as you probably know , is a remake of the disney classic i never saw , "" the absent minded professor , "" where a , well , absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as "" flubber , "" you know , flying rubber ? the new one keeps the basic plot , but appears to have added a lot else , like more absent - mindedness on the part of the proffessor , some more villains , and several "" show - stopping "" moments , like a big rumba with the flubber , and some more elaborate setups , none which really make it any better , but instead make it worse . the basic plot revolves around a college professor , philip brainerd ( robin williams ) , who creates lots and lots of inventions , but is sadly absent minded . in fact , he ' s forgotten his wedding to the college ' s president , sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden ) , two times before he forgets it again at the beginning . doesn ' t this warrant some kind of mental treatment ? anyway , on his wedding day ( the third one ) , he invents the flubber , which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed , but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in "" the abyss . "" philip believes that this invention , once fully realized , will save his college , which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon / villain , chester hoenicker ( raymond j . barry ) , which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to . through a plot twist , hoenicker ' s goons , named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check ) , discover it the hard way , and try to steal for hoenicker , who wants it just ' cause he ' s evil enough . a sub - plot involves philip ' s attempts to win back sara , who ' s angry at him ( and with good reason ) , but who is being seduced by who is basically philip ' s belloq , wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald , playing the hysterically suave - yet - unsuave asswhole once again ) . and in another subplot , philip ' s day - timer robot , weebo ( voiced by the one - and - only jodi benson ) , falls in love with him . yuckity - yuck . what ' s most pathetic about this film is how dull it is . you don ' t need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film , which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney , who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry , half - assedly re - mixing classics ( or non - classics ) for distribution to the general public , who sadly eats it all up . earlier in ' 97 , they released "" jungle 2 jungle , "" an adaptation of a really awful french film , "" un indien dans la ville , "" which , yeah , improved over the original , but not by much . disney ' s in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now , only creatively . in the rush to ship out a film for distribution , disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called "" magic . "" such scenes as dancing flubber , a flying car , a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber , and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze , delight , or even cause people to laugh . i sat there the entire film stone faced , chuckling perhaps twice , and shaking my head at all the bad jokes . who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ? didn ' t think so . it doesn ' t help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable . philip is not a lovable absent minded professory , just a really dumb man being played by robin williams . williams is a brilliant comic actor . . . okay , a brilliant actor in general , but here he ' s given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something , and other times act sad . those times , he ' s not bad . but what are we supposed to think of a man who ' s forgotten his wedding thrice ? maybe it was funny and / or respectable in the 60s . . . i like disney , and i usually enjoy their films , not only animated but live action , and their recent films ( save for "" hercules , "" which was good , but not great ) have been worse than lackluster , they ' ve been pathetic . "" jungle 2 jungle "" is probably the worst film i saw last year . "" flubber "" ' s probably second . what do they need to do ? perhaps create something new . get writers who can write something that ' s universally entertaining . films like "" the parent trap "" and "" mary poppins "" are films that are live action ( or in the latter case a mix of both ) , but even i can still watch them because they ' re not only written to be magical to children , but to be fun to adults . what ' s more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn ? and my god , couldn ' t they have done something else with edie mcclurg ?",neg,flubber be second good example how take life film remake adaptation hysterically enough be distribute disney ' s kind film be slightly entertaining tiny kid else feel leave ' boring slow incredibly lifeless be film cinematic magic be instead dead water ' s shame have be great film hypothetically mean flubber probably know be remake disney classic never see absent minded professor where absent minded professor play fred mcmurray create erratic substance know flubber know fly rubber new one keep basic plot appear have add lot else more absent mindedness part proffessor more villain several show stop moment big rumba flubber more elaborate setup none really make any well instead make bad basic plot revolve college professor philip brainerd robin william create lot lot invention be sadly absent minded fact ' s forget wedding college s president sara jean reynold indie actress marcia gay harden time forget again beginning doesn t warrant kind mental treatment wedding day third invent flubber only bounce super ball speed also change shape alien water form abyss philip believe invention once fully realize save college be threat be shut millionaire tycoon villain chester hoenicker raymond j barry be ironically enough same college brat son wheaton think be dead go plot twist hoenicker goon name smith wesson great sense humor film have be play clancy brown te levine need pay check discover hard way try steal hoenicker want just cause ' evil enough sub - plot involve philip attempt win back sara ' s angry good reason be be seduce be basically philip belloq wilson croft christopher mcdonald play hysterically suave yet unsuave asswhole once again subplot philip day timer robot weebo voice only jodi benson fall love yuckity yuck most pathetic film be how dull be don t need be cynical college student be able see right film be long line cheap attempt make quick buck disney have essentially become puff daddy film industry half assedly re - mix classic non - classic distribution general public sadly eat early release jungle jungle adaptation really awful french film un indien dan la ville improve original much disney s about as bad shape warner brother right now only creatively rush ship film distribution disney have forget give film little thing call magic such scene dance flubber fly car basketball team pretty much suck fly all thank carefully place flubber elaborate ending fail amaze delight even cause people laugh sit there entire film stone face chuckle perhaps twice shake head bad joke really laugh scene where philip enter wrong classroom start teach chemistry didn t think so doesn t help protagonist be essentially unfunny even really respectable philip be lovable absent minded professory just really dumb man be play robin william williams be brilliant comic actor brilliant actor general here ' s give very little do occasionally get hyper other time act sad time ' s bad be suppose think man ' s forget wedding thrice maybe be funny respectable 60 like disney usually enjoy film only animated live action recent film save hercule be good great have be bad lackluster ' ve be pathetic jungle jungle be probably bad film see last year flubber s probably second do need do perhaps create new get writer write universally entertaining film parent trap mary poppin be film be live action latter case mix even still watch ' re only write be magical child be fun adult s more torturous take child film insult annoy turn couldn t have do else edie mcclurg
44,"you may not have heard of lucas , or if you have , you might not think much of it . probably because it stars corey haim , or maybe because it ' s about a little geek who collects insects , or maybe because it doesn ' t feature slick one - liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80 ' s . however , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made . corey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life . one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him . her name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion . maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another . they gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover . lucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it ' s clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend . this is not clear to lucas , however . he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what ' s about to happen . we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally . they throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie . surprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school . the next scene is brilliant . maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally . she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened . he rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion . in lesser movies this would ' ve turned into a confrontation between the two characters . but maggie is written smarter than that . she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him . next we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) . he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend . what ' s interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks . of course anyone with a brain can tell what ' s gonna happen next . cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas ' relationship . this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone . she ' s been assigned to show him how to operate the washer / dryer so he can clean his shirt . maggie is charmed by cappie ' s tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body . this scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires . desperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room . it ' s not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) . lucas finally figures out what ' s going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance . this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team . the last third of the film revolves around this attempt . while the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not . there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up . dave grusin ' s memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps . lucas is filled with great performances . forget everything you know about corey haim . back in 1986 he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3 - dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain . kerri green is very appealing as maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her . sheen ' s cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas . there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti ' s ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks . also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar . when people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and john hughes that . lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so - called classics . but hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it ' s own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald . it deserves more than that , but i don ' t want to be greedy .",pos,have hear lucas have think much probably star corey haim maybe ' s about little geek collect insect maybe doesn t feature slick liner chart top soundtrack album be almost requirement teen film s however have be miss true masterpeice good film good film adolescent life ever make corey haim star lucas bligh tiny year old scruffy hair thick glass interest insect other outdoor life day stop tennis court see be angel name be maggie year old certainly be beauty lovely red hair sweet innocent complexion maggie seem be little disturb little kid watch somehow interest soon be talk get know gradually become good friend spend summer together do various thing such study insect namely locust come hiding once year play tennis listen symphony orchestra manhole cover lucas be obviously love maggie be charm ' s clear never consider more very good friend be clear lucas however still beleive maggie be soulmate dread impending start school know s happen soon find why painful scene where lucas be humiliate jock pep rally throw stage right front beloved maggie surprisingly turn table jock clown take too far be embarasse front entire school next scene be brilliant maggie follow lucas outside pep rally try talk happen rail back cruel unfair fashion less movie ' ve turn confrontation character maggie be write smart understand lucas be feel know exactly say console next be introduce great character name cappie charlie sheen be jock typical cheerleader girlfriend s interesting be stick luca protect other jock course brain tell s gon happen next cappie cause conflict maggie lucas relationship begin classic scene school laundry room when cappie maggie be alone ' be assign show how operate washer dryer clean shirt maggie be charm cappie tender undertsande demeanor mention shirtless body scene be so delicate sweet cappie still have girlfriend prevent act desire desperately try puncture tension cappie begin kick basketball room ' s long cappie do break girlfriend film only subpar scene luca finally figure s go when try pick maggie dance cause take severe action prove maggie such try football team last third film revolve attempt idea seem cliched way be execute be be many surprise last half hour lead ending so emotionally involve make most heartless cynic get choke dave grusin memorable score play perfect moment certainly help lucas be fill great performance forget know corey haim back have talent be prove here deliver perfect fully dimensional performance fill anger humor pain kerri green be very appealing maggie show why care lucas so much why be so attracted sheen cappie be almost too good be true sheen make beleivable especially when explain reason why protect lucas be other wonderful minor character such ciro popitti s ben friend lucas diminutive stature do mean take crap jock also turn few key scene be winona ryder rina girl admire lucas afar when people talk great teen angst film 80 hear john hughe john hughe lucas seem be lose crowd so call classic hopefully heather say lucas begin find ' own loyal following help people realize be more 80 anthony michael hall molly ringwald deserve more don t want be greedy

46,"capsule : one of the ten worst movies ever made . christopher lambert vs . evil ninjas in modern - day japan . . . and nobody wins . the hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain - damaged that i could almost feel affection for it . i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren ' t also insanely xenophobic and insulting . christopher lambert plays a computer - parts salesman who ' s on business in japan . he meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) . apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered . since lambert is a witness , he ' s of course the next one to die . let ' s stop and think about this for a second . if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he ' d have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock . in this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him . i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body . you know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is . this is , of course , only the beginning of the movie ' s problems . lambert eventually finds pseudo - safety with a long - haired modern - day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun . they are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows . the script doesn ' t know what the hell to do with them . lone , as the bad guy , is zero - dimensional . the only bad - guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him . in the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype . what ' s funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there ' s a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful . also , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it ' s been designed to accompany . there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re - couple the whole thing with the movie ' s relentlessly stupid plot . by the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham - handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care . we ' re not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies !

"" cool . so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie . that ' s cool , too . but , ollie , old sage , do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade . i ' m just eager to meet you one day , so i can buy you a stoli , look you in the eye and say , "" what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with u - turn ? "" and i ' ll stand there staring ' til i get a straight answer . sean penn stars u - turn , as bobby , a drifter who ' s had some troubles a while back . he ' s heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose , stranding him in superior , arizona , held there by an "" ignorant , inbred , turtleneck hick "" of a mechanic named darrell . while darrell puts a new hose on the ride , bobby walks into town to see what ' s cooking . is it needless of me to say that superior , arizona , is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely ? probably not . bobby meets up with grace ( jennifer lopez ) , who invites him back to her place , for drape - hanging and other domestic issues . just as those issues are starting up , grace ' s husband , jake , storms in , looking like check - out day of the elks lodge convention . just beats bobby silly . bobby takes to the road , only to meet up with jake again , and jake asks bobby to kill grace . a little while later , grace asks bobby to kill jake . them murderous arizonians . gotta love ' em . if any of this sounds familiar , congratulations . you win a kewpie doll . the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west , a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl , maker of the phenomenal the last seduction . but the contest doesn ' t end there , guys and gals . we get steals from russ meyer movies , where everybody in town is horny and sweaty . we get the town from bad day at black rock , minus the train , plus busty women who can speak . look at any schwarzenegger film , and you ' ll see our hero , bobby , as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times , has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times , gets bit by a tarantula , gets shot at , and ends up with vultures circling overhead , all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick . bobby as terminator ? stretch it a bit , and we have a five - finger discount from doc hollywood , where the whole story occurs because of car trouble , forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic . okay , he ' s working from a book , so maybe ollie ' s not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas . i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative . i just wish he hadn ' t brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe - stub . sean penn gives a great performance , and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be , playing over - the - top caricatures of stereotype characters . the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety - blank is going on . too bad it ' s not fun to watch when it ' s happening to us . . . while we sit through this mess of a film . u - turn is not a bad film if you ' re a fan of technique . it ' s the oliver stone you ' ve always known . robert richardson is his usual cinematographer , and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick -- great camera angles , shifting viewpoints , wicked colors , nice looking pictures . but pictures of what ? i think i ' d rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt - o - whirl point of this loser film . plot twists are one thing , repetition is almost unforgivable , and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i ' ve seen in the past five years . oliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at . you ' ve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie , and films like platoon , jfk , wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on . your scripts are certainly respectable , your budgets are up there on the screen , and your actors don ' t dog it . and i know that , maybe , with u -

48,"synopsis : the president of a company wants to test his self - appointed successor , who ' s psychotic , and thinks it ' s a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall . comments : tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it . strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape ' s sticker in black marker ( not typically a good sign when you rent a film ) . strike two came while the previews played . did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie ' s quality ( or lack thereof ) while watching the trailers that come before it ? well , the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows , and they all looked bad ( definately not a good sign ) . tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout . about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery . to be fair , the first half - hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller . wolf larson , who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant , adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film ' s title . james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten . brolin ' s character , for some inexplicable reason , thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin , practically isolated , with lebrock and larson , whom he ' s decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company . by the time the characters arrive at the cabin , this film begins to become tedious . apparently , brolin ' s successor ' s test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing , which don ' t seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city . but , then again , what do i know about business ? i do think , though , that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin ; its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch . larson ' s character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill . this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters , which really isn ' t enough to sustain it . the film ' s writer must have taken a cue from stephen king , as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and gerald ' s game . larson and lebrock fight and torture each other ( the tables get turned a couple of times ) while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help . some old guy ' s around too , just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple , who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film . the old guy , however , miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it ' s worthy of a chuckle or two . outside of that chuckle , unfortunately , tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors , for some reason , become increasing obnoxious . if you ' re in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey , don ' t . make tracks to a far superior suspense film , like misery .",neg,synopsis president company want test self appoint successor ' s psychotic think ' s great idea spend week wife isolated cabin mile civilization dependable transportation mean communication heavy snowfall comment track killer have couple strike even begin watch strike be fact have scrawl word garbage videotape s sticker black marker typically good sign when rent film strike come preview play do ever get sink premonition movie quality lack thereof watch trailer come cheesy film be advertise track killer be film one have ever hear star people one know look bad definately good sign track killer complete strikeout only positive thing film have go be fact sport nice scenery be fair first half hour so promise at least watchable thriller wolf larson bear more pass resemblance hugh grant adequately play underling obviously set killer film title jam brolin kelly lebrock seem equally adequate love couple larson later threaten brolin s character inexplicable reason think great idea spend time cabin practically isolated lebrock larson ' s decide test week give full control company time character arrive cabin film begin become tedious apparently brolin successor test involve chop wood fireplace skiing don t seem attribute necessary run business city then again do know business do think though have invest well furniture cabin bed closet have habit just break slight touch larson character accidently kill own wife rather couple want kill leave movie hour go only character really isn t enough sustain film s writer have take cue stephen king scene track killer seem lift misery gerald s game larson lebrock fight torture other table get turn couple time brolin tramp snow look help old guy s around too just killer add body count kill couple know be alive end film old guy however miraculously survive first death appear later be kill again killer scene so ludicrous ' s worthy chuckle outside chuckle unfortunately track killer just bore obvious plot be draw ad infinitum actor reason become increase obnoxious ' re video store think rent turkey don t make track far superior suspense film misery

50,"-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- summary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . unlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . the performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . longer , more detailed review : [ beware of spoilers ] the primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . you watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . matinee is not like that . i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . but most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . the comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . he is highly expressive both physically and vocally . i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . the movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . they tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . unfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . while the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . another reason i like this film is that i like b - science fiction movies . one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) while mant ! never got made , many films like it were , and mant ! serves mostly as dante ' s homage to the b - films he loves . so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . this isn ' t a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well - thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . enjoy !",pos,comedy rate pg run star john goodman kathy moriarty bunch teenager direct joe dante write charle hass summary lawrence woolsley john goodman bring new horror film mant premiere key west height cuban missile crisis hope capitalize tense moment provide escape town see most event story teenager how life affect quick easy review really enjoy matinee mixture comedy tension blend nicely many comedy film try succeed get stage do laugh maker film also care tell intelligent story performance principal be right mark particularly john goodman schlock master so definitely recommend film look light hearted interesting way spend couple hour long more detailed review beware spoiler primary reason enjoy film be be comedy film also have intelligent story tell too many comedy today subscribe notion comedy only make laugh watch movie laugh lot leave theatre take matinee be leave picture think do face cuban missile crisis find wonder happen character film most importantly find care happen character comedy film center goodman character film bring key west believe goodman be fine comedic actor business today be highly expressive physically vocally feel least deserve oscar nomination work barton fink other character be often lose scene command nature however star goodman be actually center film movie be really story teenager discover be want background where minute end think kid reaction be highly realistic try block try escape concern world unfortunately keep creep back in particularly fear chaos time comedy center goodman drama teen be great deal overlap several aspect panic be show humorous light example be scene where people be fight other last can box food grocery store think threat nuclear annihilation seem hardly be backdrop comedy work here reason like film be like science fiction movie favorite film go watch be plan outer space note do say be favorite movie favorite see mant never get make many film be mant serve mostly dante homage film love so again like recommend matinee look good humorous story isn t gag film many other comedy intelligent well thought film real people real problem tell often hilarious way enjoy
51,"once upon a time a solitary ogre named shrek ( mike myers ) was really annoyed to discover that his swamp had been invaded by three blind mice , seven dwarves and all the other fairy tale characters in the land , banished from their home by lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) . unwittingly befriended by a non - stop talking donkey ( eddie murphy ) , shrek travels to dulloc to speak with farquaad , where he stumbles into a joust and comes up the winner . his prize ? to save princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) from a tower surrounded by molten flame and protected by a dragon so she can become farquaad ' s bride . the ogre agrees to the task in return for getting his solitary lifestyle back in "" shrek . "" it took four writers ( ted elliott and terry rossio ( "" the road to el dorado "" ) , roger s . h . schulman ( "" balto "" ) and joe stillman ( "" beavis and butthead do america "" ) ) to adapt william steig ' s children ' s book . the bad news ? they ' ve genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under the influence of william goldman ' s "" the princess bride . "" the good news ? there ' s so much wacky humor culled from both fairy tales and popular culture that this movie should keep you in stitches . we get our first inkling that we ' re in for a real treat as one of farquaad ' s men , intent on rounding up magical creatures offers ' five schillings for the possessed boy ! ' after observing dreamworks ' rendition of disney ' s animated pinocchio . meanwhile within the castle walls , a gingerbread man being tortured by farquaad spits icing and yells ' eat me ! ' before breaking down and solemnly asking ' do you know the muffin man ? ' shrek , a green giant with bobbly antennae - like ears , is a grumpy recluse who really yearns to fit in ( although who could put up with his habit of making candles from his own ear wax ? ) . donkey is a hyperactive , endearingly stunted creature who can talk and , therefore , believes will make a great misfit pairing with the uncooperative shrek . donkey proves his worth sweet talking the princess - guarding dragon . the princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat after learning she ' s not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she ' s been expecting . when fiona ' s true colors are exposed ( including opportunies for some tomboyish gross out humor ) , a spark develops between her and shrek . the script ' s details are gleefully impish , constantly poking fun at disney from the theme park world of farquaad ' s dulloc with its turnstyle entrance and ' it ' s a small world ' parody of an information booth to the blue bird which meets a most un - disneyish fate after duetting with fiona ' snow white ' style . popular culture is represented with film references to "" babe "" and "" charlies ' angels "" via "" the matrix . "" myers chooses his ' so i married an axe murderer ' scottish brogue for shrek in order to give his voice some heft . while this may prove distracting for anyone familiar with that film , overall it works more than not . eddie murphy steals the show as the fast - talking , motown - singing donkey , proving once again his talent as a vocal performer ( is it another wink at disney that donkey is paired with a dragon , a creature murphy portrayed in disney ' s ' mulan ? ' ) . lithgow ' s a good choice for the supercilious , height - challenged villain lord farquaad . diaz is energetic but ultimately nondescript voicing princess fiona . ( a better choice would have been minnie driver , who ' s proven herself a terrific vocal talent in such diverse animations as disney ' s "" tarzan , "" "" princess mononoke "" and the "" south park "" movie . ) the computer animation looks terrific ( particularly donkey ) , although it won ' t elicit the types of oohs and aahs of pixar ' s work ( "" toy story , "" "" a bug ' s life , "" "" toy story 2 "" ) . in keeping with its hip style , pop music is used , which like myer ' s voice may be initially jarring , but ultimately satisfies ( while surveying bridal candidates via a ' dating game ' parody broadcast by snow white ' s evil queen ' s mirror , farquaad is told ' fiona likes pina coladas ' - cue jimmy buffet ! ) .

54,"porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie ( diane keaton ) for twenty - five years . they and best friends mona ( goldie hawn ) and griffin ( garry shandling ) are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen , "" town and country . "" "" town and country "" has a pedigree befitting it ' s title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry ( "" the graduate "" ) under the direction of peter chelsom ( "" funny bones "" ) . after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates , the media has been prepped for beatty ' s next "" ishtar . "" so , is it that bad ? the answer is no . but it ' s not very good either . the major problem with "" town and country "" is that it ' s unstructured and random . stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski ) . next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin . then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples ' divorce lawyer ) . ellie thinks she ' s overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family ' s mississippi manse . the two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they ' d never become a couple to begin with . back home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter ' s cheating on her . porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he ' s gay . the four friends , along with every woman porter ' s dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after . although the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere . the stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , "" the virgin suicides "" and tricia vessey , "" kiss the girls "" ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who ' s just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home . after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out - of - nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son . porter ' s romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled . once the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm . while beatty gets off a few tart observations , his character is mostly passive and bemused . maybe we ' re supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn ' t initiate his own sex romps ? keaton ' s ellie has a trusting nature that ' s a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character . hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of "" the out of towners "" and "" the first wives ' club "" while shandling ' s relegated to true second banana status . kinski is bland and unmotivated . andie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay ' s most bizarre subplot , which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting , billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic , wheelchair - bound , foul - mouthed mother . heston and seldes are fun , as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party . oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look , but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like "" hear my song "" and "" funny bones .

"" kiss of the dragon "" is the name of an acupuncture maneuver , in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victim ' s neck , somehow redirecting all of the body ' s bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately . there ' s a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute , whose daughter is being held hostage , for some reason , by the villain . this is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen , even worse than the one in pearl harbor . there ' s no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it ; it ' s only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boy - meets - girl subplot . kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson , whose screenplay the messenger : the story of joan of arc , for all of that film ' s flaws , was at least thoughtful . i don ' t know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck , but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic . i suppose you could call this mainstream , but i ' ll choose the bizarre any time of the day . if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling , you need a story to justify watching them . the filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy . no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling , but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks .",neg,appreciate didn t do again star jet li bridget fonda tch karyo burt kwouk direct chris nahon rate r ' s secret martial art film often use plot simply get action sequence when fight scene be enough justify pay admission be problem most jackie chan project lot hong kong actioner when aren t ' re bad shape kiss dragon jet li second consecutive american misfire play big miscalculation fail even most rudimentary entertainment now start get e - mail angrily tout genius jet li let explain li be as spectacular ever here don t think ever dare call martial art star skill question problem t ' s movie s tone much tout fight scene here be film such unflinche unrelenting brutality be unpleasant watch ' re joyless perfuctory li rogue chinese detective be more kill machine hero terminator black belt instead metal skeleton even terminator judgement day have sympathetic side plot isn t relevant ' re curious ' s nonsense chinese law enforcement officer li send paris investigate possible drug ring encounter corrupt chief police tcheky karyo kill people do sinister thing motivation whatsoever li character be also acupuncture expert be able ease pain kill touch needle kiss dragon be name acupuncture maneuver stick needle precise location back victim neck somehow redirect body bloodflow brain kill poor sap more less immediately s vague attempt humanize li have fall love downtrodden prostitute daughter be be hold hostage reason villain be bad love story have ever see screen even bad pearl harbor s conviction whatsoever movie barely pay lip service ' s only here apparently think be kind boy meet girl subplot kiss dragon be write luc besson screenplay messenger story joan arc film s flaw be least thoughtful don t know why guy get involve train wreck perhaps want so more mainstream neverending weirdness fifth element aforementione stylize biopic suppose call mainstream ' choose bizarre time day action scene movie be go be brutal instead dazzling need story justify watch filmmaker kiss dragon have rethink strategy one walk misbegotten project smile hear rush hour be come just few week

57,"the thought - provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of "" leila , "" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty - year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features . although unfamiliar with mehrjui ' s previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers . set in modern - day iran , "" leila "" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) . as leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn ' t quite as sweet . earlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . when all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn ' t care at all about having children . nonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self - esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother - in - law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . leila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens ' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn ' t give her full blessing . there are no easy answers to be found within "" leila , "" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character ' s unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter - of - fact narration . almost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother - in - law ' s requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . maybe because "" leila "" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . leila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . these "" small "" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . refusing to stay over at her parent ' s house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . despite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . sure , the whole second marriage was his mother ' s idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn ' t he ? in the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . unlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . for all of its strong aspects , "" leila "" isn ' t a perfect film . on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . and concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . mehrjui ' s decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother - in - law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . despite these minor missteps , "" leila "" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york ' s cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . the thought - provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila ' s self - worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . it ' s difficult to not consider how leila ' s culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through .",pos,thought provoke question tradition moral be subject directly core leila powerfully articulated subtle drama

58,"the "" disney stick - to - what - you - do - best "" rule states that disney ' s animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at live - action kids ' entertainment , they will fail miserably . this goes double for occasions when they try to make a live - action adaptation of a popular cartoon ( remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations ? i ' m still trying to forget ) . that rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget , an insulting , despicable and , worst of all , expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children ' s film . it will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults , even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes . it ' s films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects . just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet , his career takes a nosedive to hell with his "" role "" as john brown , a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him . he dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush , dr . brenda bradford ( joely fisher ) . but after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer . john breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr . brenda ' s father . dr . brenda has been working on a "" gadget project , "" which would make a half - man half - machine super - policeman to fight crime . feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject , realizing his dream of becoming a policeman . now , when he says "" go go gadget [ insert name of gizmo here ] "" he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks , bang up bandits and mangle murderers . in the meantime , the evil claw ( rupert everett ) , the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor ' s father is building a gadget of his own : a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown ' s worst nemesis . claw has plans of world domination , which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile ( voice of d . l . hughley ) to save humanity from his wrath . state of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $ 90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere . had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect . what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal : all of the expensive f / x amounts to nothing . part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie . can kids really admire a hero so goody - two - shoes that he screams "" hey ! you ran a stop sign ! "" while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle ? i think that today ' s children will respond better to somebody dashing , someone ultra - cool . they ( probably ) receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt . in addition to the more complex complaints above , there ' s also the simple stuff : inspector gadget is boring , formulaic and achingly implausible . there ' s no feeling that the director really cares about his story : more than any other film i ' ve seen this year , this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line . there ' s a popular commercial ( for sprite , but that ' s irrelevant ) running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects . it consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious ( thank god ) movie called "" death slug "" . each executive gleefully presents a different merchandise tie - in ( slug taco ! slug on a stick ! ) . at the end one of them asks "" what about the movie ? "" another answers : "" well , we don ' t have a script yet , but we can bang one out by friday . "" they probably could have replaced "" death slug "" with inspector gadget . this film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script . it ' s no coincidence that most good children ' s entertainment these days comes from animation . animated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work . these kinds of films are banged out quicker and a good percentage turn out worthless , sloppy and impersonal . the studios are becoming factories and films their assembled products . ? 1999 eugene novikov &# 137 ;",neg,disney stick do good rule state disney animate feature invariably be sublime whenever try hand live action kid entertainment fail miserably go double occasion when try make live action adaptation popular cartoon remember version dalmation ' m still try forget rule prove more dependable ever inspector gadget insulting despicable bad expensive piece trash try pass viable child s film bore prove unbearable adult even relatively skinny run time minute ' film make want go local blockbuster rent day when brain be more important budget wit compensate lack fancy effect just matthew broderick begin convince be hope actor yet career take nosedive hell role john brown depressed security guard big heart hope day become real policeman help people dream heroic deed subsequent admiration long time crush dr brenda bradford joely fisher few bizarre coincidence seem have dream no long john break bone body try save dr brenda father brenda have be work gadget project make half man half machine super - policeman fight crime feel indebted john decide save life make subject realize dream become policeman now when say go go gadget insert name gizmo here use kind nifty gadget capture crook bang bandit mangle murderer meantime evil claw rupert everett man responsible murder good doctor father be build gadget own carbon copy inspector gadget evil john brown bad nemesis claw have plan world domination leave inspector gadget mobile voice d l hughley save humanity wrath state art effect fly mad pace dollar movie yet director david kelogg never set convincing atmosphere have replace fancy gizmo dollar bill have wind same effect see screen be raw ingredient meal expensive amount part charm tv series be sly irreverence have go toilet condescend movie kid really admire hero so goody shoe scream run stop sign hang back bumper quickly move vehicle think today child respond well dash ultra - cool probably receive enough preaching parent insult intelligence assume want go action movie see father figure kick butt addition more complex complaint above s also simple stuff inspector gadget be boring formulaic achingly implausible s feeling director really care story more other film ' ve see year one really feel be make assembly line s popular commercial sprite ' irrelevant run movie theater feature spoof way major studio deal project consist studio suit discuss fictitious god movie call death slug executive gleefully present different merchandise tie in slug taco slug stick end ask movie answer don t have script yet bang out friday probably have replace death slug inspector gadget film contain sort logical contradiction blatantly obvious adherence formula have be eliminate have attention be pay script ' s coincidence most good child entertainment day come animation animate feature take so long maker become labor love filmmaker put care pride work kind film be bang quick good percentage turn worthless sloppy impersonal studio be become factory film assemble product eugene novikov #
59,"i ' m not really sure what to think about "" crash . "" on the surface , it ' s a cold , boring , unerotic porn with name starts , a name director , and some cool camerawork . i mean , it left me completely bored , unsatisfied , and generally kinda weirded out . but then again , not every film ' s supposed to leave you entertained . "" crash "" is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue . while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization . not to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we don ' t really see a lot of the actors completely exposed . but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience . this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of "" henry and june "" or the just plain horniness of , say , "" deep throat "" ( not that i ' ve seen it ) . if one was to be made completely hot by this film , it would probably mean they were also into the whole "" auto eroticism "" thing . the film leaves you cold erotically ( and maybe in many other ways ) , but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge . the film opens up on a woman , catherine ( deborah kara ungar , of "" the game "" ) , pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar . suddenly , a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind ( the film doesnt ' show all this though , even if it is nc - 17 ) . the next scene has a film director , james ( james spader ) , having sex with a camera woman ( alice poon ) in an office on the highly - populated set of his movie . the next scene has the two coming together , revealing to us that they ' re husband and wife , and them sharing in one another ' s escapades . while the two are arguably freaky people , we at least know they love to live on the edge . soon afterwards , james is driving down the road at night , reclessly of course ( he ' s reading something ) , when he drifts into the other lane , and then hits another car face on . james is not killed , but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat ( obviously dying ) , leaving the driver , helen remington ( holly hunter - in a porn ? ) , also alive . the two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again . when james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident . you wouldn ' t think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish , but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan ( elias kosteas ) and his crutch - carrying girlfriend , gabrielle ( rosanna arquette ) , who are also into it . vaughan is into living on the edge as they are , but he takes it to another level : he loves to recreate famous car crashes . in one scene , he and a friend , colin seagrave ( peter macneill ) recreate james dean ' s car crash without any padding or safety belts , and suffer some concussions , but nevertheless get a rush ( and the attention of the police ) . soon , these five are all having sex with one another , be it straight , gay , or lesbian sex . while this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who ' s main fetish is living on the edge . i ' m sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally don ' t see a connection between car crashes and sex . the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush . his car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini - masterpieces : we ' re at first not sure if they ' ll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp . then when it happens , we hold our breath . the same thing happens with sex , although not in the same fashion . these people are merely taking it to another level . the only problem with the film is that it ' s a tad redundant . a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half . this goes on for about 100 minutes , and it just seems a little too long . the sex and car crashes are far between one another , and the time between them are a tad on the boring side . there ' s no characterization , although it could definitely be argued , that hey , it ' s a porn , and we ' re not here to sympathize . but still , they coulda cut it down a bit . but the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements . the atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling . and there are several scenes are just amazing . one scene has catherine and james having sex , while she softly asks him questions about being with a man , which sounds almost erotic the way she says it . a sequence involving one character ' s death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs . and the final shot is shot perfectly , creating an image of a car crash , and a couple having sex in front of it , despite the fact that she ' s wounded . the acting is also pretty good , especially for what is almost a porn ( ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn ) . while james spader is pretty boring ( he ' s usually pretty intense ) , deborah kara ungar is amazing . she speaks all her words in almost zombie - like hushes , and when she ' s having sex , she has a blank look on her face , not showing the viewer whether she ' s enjoying it or not . in one scene , she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her . holly hunter , who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this , is pretty good , and so is rosanna arquette ( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role ) . but the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone . he often speaks as he is out of breath , showing a definite affinity for his way of life . he has a great deal of energy in several scenes , especially one scene where he ' s taking photographs of a picture , and a later scene where he ' s getting a freaky tatoo . he and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes , foreshadowing a later scene . kosteas is a little known actor ( his biggest role was casey jones in "" teenage mutant ninja turtles "" ) , but here he shows a deniro - like presence , hinting that he ' s capable of bigger roles . while i hardly enjoyed "" crash , "" it ' s still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who , if the exist , are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world . these people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities , and the film , which doesn ' t exactly pain them in a negative light , is sucessful in bringing them to light , even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out . despite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc - 17 rating ( there ' s also an r - rated version , but i wouldn ' t even go near that thing ) , anyone looking for a quick turn - on should just rent a regular porno .",pos,' m really sure think crash surface ' s cold boring unerotic porn name start name director cool camerawork mean leave completely bored unsatisfied generally kinda weirde then again film s suppose leave entertain crash be structure play porn flick significantly more plot dialogue see several extremely taboo scene weirdo sex also have skimpy little plot go mostly beginning maybe just hair characterization mention acting be generally pretty good don t really see lot actor completely expose make supremely different porn be fact be erotic experience film do posess erotic hypnotism henry june just plain horniness deep throat ' ve see be be make completely hot film probably mean be also whole auto eroticism thing film leave cold erotically maybe many other way do be present group people live edge film open woman catherine deborah kara ungar game press bare breast car public air hangar suddenly man enter frame begin take film do show though even be next scene have film director jame jame spader have sex camera woman alice poon office highly populated set movie next scene have come together reveal ' re husband wife share escapade be arguably freaky people least know love live edge soon afterwards jame be drive road night reclessly course ' read when drift other lane then hit car face jame be kill passenger other car fly seat obviously die leave driver helen remington holly hunter porn also alive go therapy together when get run eachother again when jame give ride home almost get accident immeadiately afterwards go unbusy parking lot have little quickie be arouse accident wouldn t think be many people share same kind fetish run freaky guy name vaughan kostea crutch carry girlfriend gabrielle rosanna arquette be also vaughan be live edge be take level love recreate famous car crash scene friend colin seagrave peter macneill recreate jame dean car crash padding safety belt suffer concussion nevertheless get rush attention police soon be have sex be straight gay lesbian sex be admittingly bit comical film be almost black comedy film do do pretty awesome portrayal people ' main fetish be live edge ' m sure somewhere be people get arouse car accident personally don t see connection car crash sex main connection cronenberg show give definite rush car crash scene be quick exciting mini -

61,"star wars : episode i - the phantom menace review a review by jamey hughton stars ) starring - liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman and jake lloyd director - george lucas rated g with all the hype that star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace has been receiving , it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film . the movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever , with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders , the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together . can george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . ? yes . this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch , with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity . but that doesn ' t mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment . the phantom menace features the most eye - catching , jaw - dropping visual look in cinematic history . the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest , and the special effects are nothing short of the best ( and most plentiful ) to ever be caught on film . the vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding . the phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses , even if it has some disappointing aspects . after we ' re treated to the famous prologue in the sky , with john williams ' thundering score , we meet qui - gon jonn ( liam neeson ) and young obi - wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , a jedi master and his trainee ` padawan ' . they are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation , and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo . oh , but enough about that . the prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) into the picture . as you already know , this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader . a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter . this particular race is the most exciting , energetic , high - octane action sequence that you ' ll ever see . one of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised , and the phantom menace is no exception . i loved sebulba , the rat - like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race , and boss nass , the leader of the gungans ( who are a neighbouring species to naboo ) . one character who has been subject to criticism is jar - jar binks , a member of the gungan race . jar - jar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug , and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief . yes , he is initially annoying , but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless , goofy antics . there is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry , but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses . the final light - saber battle , between the jedi ' s and the horrific ( and terminally underused ) villain darth maul , is spectacular to behold . jabba the hutt , yoda , c - 3po and r2 - d2 have cameo appearances . lucas has not forget how to captivate an audience , even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness . one can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments , episode ' s i and ii . when they arrive , you ' ll know where to find me .",pos,star war episode phantom menace review review jamey hughton star star liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman jake lloyd director george lucas rate g hype star war episode phantom menace have be receive seem almost impossible avoid interest see film movie be easily most anticipate motion picture ever marketing campaign so strong have bring colonel sander taco bell chihuahua pizza hut together george luca succeed yet again transport back long time ago galaxy far far away star war prequel be bad bunch amateurish dialogue overall lack humanity doesn t mean fail comply basis solid entertainment phantom menace feature most eye catch jaw drop visual look cinematic history tremendous action sequence have cling arm rest special effect be short good most plentiful ever be catch film vast digitize world sheer imagination be apply project be astounding phantom menace be delectable feast sense even have disappointing aspect ' re treat famous prologue sky john william thunder score meet qui gon jonn liam neeson young obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor jedi master trainee padawan be ship accommodate fleet headquarters evil trade federation have be send settle dispute regard taxation trade route planet naboo enough prime concern prequel be introduce young anakin skywalker jake lloyd picture already know seemingly charming lad be boy soon become darth vader spectacular pod race come soon hereafter particular race be most exciting energetic high octane action sequence ' ever see delight series be meet new set strange alien creature lucas have devise phantom menace be exception love sebulba rat like scoundrel anakin have face pod race boss nass leader gungan be neighbouring specie naboo character have be subject criticism be jar jar bink member gungan race jar jar speak roger rabbit hallucinogenic drug be there sole purpose supply comic relief be initially annoying admit laugh harmless goofy antic be lack dramatic pull star war entry presentation almost make forget plot character lapse final light saber battle jedi s horrific terminally underused villain darth maul be spectacular behold jabba hutt 3po r2 d2 have cameo appearance lucas have forget how captivate audience even late show obvious sign tiredness only wonder possible technology present next installment episode s when arrive ' know where find
62,"we all know the fate of "" child ' s play , "" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell . with the newest installment in the quasi - popular series currently out ( that would be "" bride of chucky "" - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it ' s kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about . alas , the original "" child ' s play "" actually isn ' t that bad . even seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically - challenged theatre at my college wasn ' t the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don ' t believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn ' t a bad movie . it ' s not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don ' t have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , "" i know what you did last summer "" has recently gone . the premise of "" child ' s play "" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard - boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid ' s doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest - looking kid ' s doll i ' ve ever seen . the next day , a bum who ' s stolen it sells it to single - mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday . of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up . like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy . and soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky isn ' t just a kiddie doll one by one . the idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that . it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they ' re crazy . it plays with this , as well as the whole child - like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments . even if there ' s an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later !

66,"an american werewolf in london is john landis ' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england . the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects . more specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character . even twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive . although , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive . the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure . if it weren ' t for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 . and with good reason -- the acting isn ' t great and neither is the writing . well ok , we don ' t actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film . but one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn ' t scary . with no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens . you don ' t even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint . i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen . but john , it just wasn ' t scary . i didn ' t know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn ' t work for me . actually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films . but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me . it ' s never a good sign that you don ' t realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material . call me crazy , but you shouldn ' t have to do research on a movie to enjoy it . i ' m not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up . werewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) . boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy . including , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital . the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse . i know it sounds strange , but it actually works . the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie . as i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects . while they are still impressive today , they aren ' t impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film . and since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch . actually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn ' t take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way .",neg,american werewolf london be john landi groundbreaking feature american tourist get bite werewolf jolly old england groundbreaking part movie be special effect more specifically makeup use transformation man werewolf ghost haunt main character even year release part movie be still impressive have say really be only part movie be consider impressive rest movie be run mill werewolf flick extra gore throw good measure weren t cut edge makeup effect use werewolf transformation be most likely be film have go largely unnoticed when be release back good reason act isn t great be writing don t actually expect thing be great horror film other important element be lack here too isn t scary exception know be go happen happen don t even need obligatory scary music give hint give director john landis credit be good look horror film have ever see john just wasn t scary didn t know be intend be sort romantic drama whole werewolf thing be just throw get people come theater see didn t work actually be intend sort spoof horror film mix comedic moment melodrama be so bad intend humor be lose ' s never good sign don t realize movie be suppose be funny movie be long over read background material call crazy shouldn t have do research movie enjoy ' m even go get plot movie much title pretty well sum whole thing werewolf bite boy david naughton boy end hospital where be tend eventually fall pretty nurse jenny agutter then strange thing begin happen boy include admit be very nice touch visit friend be kill same werewolf attack end hospital neat thing here be buddy be rapidly deteriorate corpse know sound strange actually work scene david naughton dead buddy griffin dunne be really good part movie say probably only reason film be hit be special effect be still impressive today aren t impressive enough plentiful enough warrant watch film be more less highlight film be far well choice out there want scary movie curl sweetheart watch actually sequel american werewolf paris be more entertaining doesn t take seriously actually provide few more laugh way
67,"the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily . three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making . they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house . from there , things become a little more complicated . i can say , with absolute assurance , that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me . although i know it was all a staged "" mockumentary "" , there ' s no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you . i didn ' t feel much upon initially watching it . i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts . i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend . i ' ve gotten chills every time i ' ve brought it up since then . this is not a movie that hits you right away . instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine , waits until you think everything is okay , then it slowly starts to creep it ' s way up into your mind . this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch . the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film , so don ' t expect any steadi - cam shots or fancy camera work . this is as real as it gets folks . i don ' t recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though , because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera . the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real , you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not . this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing , especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera . the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape - to - film transfer done for the big screen . word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras ( hours of deleted scenes , alternate endings , commentary , the sci - fi channel special , and others ) is being planned for release . i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd ' s . i know i ' ll be first in line to buy one .

68,"krippendorf ' s tribe is a formula comedy . done poorly , formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema . however , every now and then , one emerges , like krippendorf ' s tribe , that actually works . professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) , the renowned anthropologist , is in trouble . his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea . however , he found . . . nothing . his wife has recently died , and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids : shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) and edmund ( carl michael lidner ) . tonight , he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe . rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids ) . however , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon . soon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members . his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over - eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) . krippendorf ' s tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief . no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes . luckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by . though there ' s some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies . the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the film ' s latter scenes is superb . richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe . jenna elfman ' s position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times , but she plays the part with extreme affability . even the kids , who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side , are endearing and humorous . yes , the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor , but it has the best excuse of all : it ' s funny . it may not go down as an all - time classic , but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs .",pos,tribe be formula comedy do poorly formulaic comedy seem signify downfall american cinema however now then emerge krippendorf tribe actually work professor jam richard dreyfuss renowned anthropologist be trouble university give hefty grant discover lost tribe new guinea however find wife have recently die have spend remainder grant money raise kid shelly natasha mickey gregory smith edmund carl michael lidner tonight be expect lecture newfound tribe rather break news face consequence misuse fund invent tribe shelmikedmu name kid however lie beget be only require deliver film proof shelmikedmu research become popular phenomenon soon professor krippendorf be catch elaborate ruse film mockumentary footage star child shelmikedmu tribal member effort be hamper boast eager colleague veronica micelli jenna elfman intense scrutiny rival anthropologist ruth allen lily tomlin krippendorf tribe do seem require little suspension disbelief one seem question way field documentary seem be shoot multiple camera newly discover tribesman have startlingly blue eye luckily film build momentum suspension disbelief be easy come s mild humor krippendorf family try pass lost tribe real humor film be how jame get trap ever increase snowball lie double meaning many shelmikedmu appearance be enjoyable comic timing require film latter scene be superb richard dreyfuss be terrific hapless professor soon lose control own imaginary tribe jenna elfman position romantic lead seem bit force time play part extreme affability even kid film tend be bit precocious side be endear humorous film do veer occasionally rather lowbrow humor have good excuse ' s funny go time classic certainly deliver expect comedy plenty laugh
69,"most sequels don ' t do what they ' re supposed to do like "" toy story 2 "" does . far too many of them end up re - hashing the original and adding very little . is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ? thankfully , "" toy story 2 "" is a wonderful exception . i can ' t remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one . it ' s yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind "" toy story "" and "" a bug ' s life , "" is still at the top of its game . woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit "" toy story , "" and things have changed a bit since the last one ended . woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp . in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge . unfortunately , woody ' s trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over - zealous toy collector ( wayne knight ) . off to save him are buzz and members of the old "" toy gang , "" including mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney ) . while in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950 ' s children ' s show entitled "" woody ' s roundup . "" he meets the show ' s other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse . they have all been anxiously awaiting woody ' s arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever . this means woody now faces a difficult choice . with his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ? as in the original film , "" toy story 2 "" contains first - rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct - to - video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . the film is well worth seeing on the big screen . the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more "" human . "" the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . there are so many impressive sequences that i ' d find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al ' s toy barn , the store owned by woody ' s captor . pixar ' s rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . "" toy story 2 "" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn ' t yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan - aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . it may be computer - animated , and it may have sappy music , but it ' s downright touching . the script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it ' s a sequel . the reason "" toy story 2 "" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original ' s success by re - doing the same story and using the same characters . not this one . we get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . "" toy story 2 "" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . the humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . there are funny asides to films such as "" star wars "" and "" jurassic park , "" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock ' em sock ' em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts "" a bug ' s life "" and the 1997 short "" geri ' s game .

70,"that thing you do ! ( r ) tom hanks ' s screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh - so - nice . it is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this ' 60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast . that thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , "" that thing you do ! "" the group ' s members are , naturally a diverse group : there ' s brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl - crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film ' s center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz . along for the wonders ' ride to success is jimmy ' s perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) . hanks proves to be a capable writer - director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls "" the last innocent year . "" the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes -- but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it ' s still playing in my mind as i write this ) . it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film ' s biggest and best dramatic moment . the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early ' 60s ; they do not appear to be ' 90s grungers playacting "" retro . "" yet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it ' s nearly nice to a fault . while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting . everyone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all -- except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel - good note . there isn ' t much of an edge throughout that thing -- the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks ' s turn as the wonders ' manager -- and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it ' s bland . but a little niceness goes a long way these days , and there ' s no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; it ' s just about impossible to hate . it ' s an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not singing , "" that thing you do !

72,"the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment . with she ' s all that and varsity blues behind us , and several more set for release later in the year , the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance . however , you wouldn ' t know it from the quality of the latest entry : jawbreaker . this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center . the most popular , and most feared , clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma . they have accidentally killed one of their own , the "" teen dream "" , liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) , choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday . now the three surviving girls must decide what to do . it takes little time at all for the group ' s leader , courtney ( rose mcgowan ) , to decide to cover it up . the ditzy marcie ( julie benz ) is game to go along , but the clique ' s final member , julie ( rebecca gayheart ) , has a guilty conscience . to make things worse , another student , the hopelessly geeky fern mayo ( judy evans greer ) accidentally discovers the truth . the girls ' cover is surely blown . . . not so fast . thinking quickly , courtney offers fern a once - in - a - lifetime chance . after a quick makeover , fern is transformed into vylette , the beautiful "" new girl "" at school , and a full - fledged member of the popular crowd . does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder ? or will this finely honed plan crack over time ? jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation , and failing miserably , i might add . it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations , but misses three crucial elements : sharp dialogue , witty characters and the much - needed humor . it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being ( darkly ) humorous if it wasn ' t shackled to its dead - weight plot . the film ' s most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo . at this point , jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths . but then , all of a sudden , the innovation stops . the film becomes mired in the murder - and - cover - up plotting , which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film . in the film , rose mcgowan fares the best . as the manipulative clique leader , she truly dominates every scene she ' s in ( not a difficult feat in a crowd such as this , however ) . it ' s a character crying out for a better movie ( or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact . ) jawbreaker doesn ' t quite know how to handle its semi - likable characters : fern and julie . either one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows . the lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters . as their motives become murky and unclear , the film finally falls to the point that it doesn ' t really matter who wins or loses , since all sides have become equally detestable .

73,"confession time : i have never , ever seen gone with the wind . i don ' t know why , really . haven ' t wanted to check it out on video , haven ' t been at home the nights it was on network tv , and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big - screen . so right up front , i ' ll admit that i don ' t know what the heck i ' m talking about , but here goes . . . is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990 ' s ? maybe that ' s going a little bit too far . as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie , they ' re no clark gable and vivien leigh . but . . . the parallels are there . gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor . titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors . gwtw places america ' s greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic ' s most legendary tragedy . they both have strong - willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves / steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular . . . ok , maybe that ' s not enough parallels . so titanic ' s not in gwtw ' s league . no matter . titanic is a great movie in its own right , complete with spills , thrills and ( especially ) chills . much has been made of the humongous cost of the production , and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again . the money was obviously well - spent . the costumes look great , the sets look great , the cgi graphics look great . i especially liked the expensive little touches , like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks . but writer / director / producer james cameron ' s real challenge in writing / directing / producing titanic wasn ' t just costuming and set design and special effects . cameron ' s major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in . he succeeds masterfully . cameron does two things that work incredibly well . first , he shows us modern - day salvage operations on titanic ( that ' s just "" titanic "" , not "" the titanic "" , mind you ) . the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state , corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic , from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) . television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101 - year - old rose calvert ( gloria stuart ) , who survived the wreck in 1912 . stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role , narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew . secondly , cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character , and the romantic triangle between rose ( winslet ) , her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley ( billy zane ) and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon ( dicaprio ) . the way that big - budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all - star cast , so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people . cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack , while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board . the supporting cast is professional , but mostly anonymous -- other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown , there ' s no moment when you stop and say , oh , yeah , i know him , what ' s he been in . ( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform , or even as the ill - fated engineer . ) the love story itself is rather conventional . i think some reviewers found it weak , and that may be a fair criticism . the performances are the key here . zane has the meatiest part in the movie , and he plays the arrogant , condescending steel millionaire to the hilt . he ' s smooth , he looks great in a tuxedo , and he ' s a convincing enough jerk that the winslet - dicaprio relationship looks plausible . at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat , you can hear the wheels in his mind turning , saying not "" can i save this little girl ? "" , but "" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? "" dicaprio is a revelation . i hadn ' t seen him before in anything , and didn ' t know what the heck to expect , really . ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . ) dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it ' s hard not to like him . from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters . winslet ' s character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance . at first , she ' s not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop - dead gorgeous . we know from the narration that she ' s monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn ' t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio . winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg . it ' s at that moment where winslet ' s character really comes alive . faced with real danger , she drops her spoiled - rich - girl mannerisms and does a splendid job . as rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal ' s fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror . of course , the most interesting character is the ship itself . cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain ' s table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead . cameron ' s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well .",pos,confession time have never ever see go wind don t know why really haven t want check video haven t be home night be network tv be too far drive last time be big screen so right front ' admit don t know ' m talk here go be titanic go wind s maybe s go little bit too far as good job leonardo dicaprio kate winslet do movie ' re clark gable vivien leigh parallel be there gwtw be first movie take real advantage most revolutionary technology available technicolor titanic take revolutionary step forward seamlessly integrate computer graphic design actor gwtw place america great tragedy background classic love story titanic do same atlantic most legendary tragedy have strong willed redheaded heroine exploit class difference aristocracy slave steerage bum be incredibly expensive popular maybe s enough parallel so titanic s gwtw s league no matter titanic be great movie own right complete spill thrill especially chill much have be make humongous cost production care go make huge luxury liner come alive again money be obviously well spend costume look great set look great cgi graphic look great especially like expensive little touch spend ton money authentic titanic china only break floor ship sink writer director producer jame cameron real challenge writing direct produce titanic wasn t just costume set design special effect cameron major headache be keep audience interested tale where know ending go succeed masterfully cameron do thing work incredibly well first show modern day salvage operation titanic s just titanic titanic mind first glimpse get titanic be ship present state corrode slowly away hammering pressure north atlantic window minisub pilot treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton television coverage exploration titanic intrigue year old rose calvert gloria stuart survive wreck stuart do phenomenal job brief role narrate story experience stunned paxton roughneck crew secondly cameron keep storyline focus almost exclusively rose character romantic triangle rose winslet bastard millionaire fiancee hockley billy zane irrepressible young artist jack daswon dicaprio way big budget disaster movie usually go wrong be have star cast so see impact disaster wide group people cameron wisely choose stick rose jack pay scant heed celebrity board support cast be professional mostly anonymous other kathy bate unsinkable molly brown s moment when stop say know s be in like have see colm meaney white star uniform even ill fate engineer love story be rather conventional think reviewer find weak be fair criticism performance be key here zane have meaty part movie play arrogant condescend steel millionaire hilt ' smooth look great tuxedo ' s convincing enough jerk winslet dicaprio relationship look plausible moment when see little girl too frightened get lifeboat hear wheel mind turning say save little girl help get lifeboat dicaprio be revelation hadn t see before didn t know heck expect really honestly expect bad irish accent cameron evidently decide be bad idea dicaprio play poor american artist win ticket poker game dicaprio exhibit infectious joy be alive be titanic ' s hard like moment ship leave port hit iceberg dicaprio have carry movie keep interest never falter winslet character grow lot movie so do performance first ' s require do wear period clothing look drop dead gorgeous know narration ' s monstrously unhappy arrange marriage zane isn t expression feeling encounter dicaprio winslet dicaprio develop chemistry manage propel movie along ship hit iceberg ' s moment where winslet character really come alive face real danger drop spoiled rich girl mannerism do splendid job rose jack race doom ship look shelter freeze water fiery temper winslet turn superb act performance mix courage compassion anger sheer shriek terror course most interesting character be ship cameron have clearly fall love titanic show mood deserted wreck down boiler room up bridge down hold captain s table down steerage manage bring great ship back dead cameron great gift be allow fall love titanic as well
74,"i ' ve never been a member of the robin williams fan club . a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i ' m watching a 40 - year - old class clown . in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy - feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . mrs . doubtfire seemed ready - made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams ' best comic screen project yet . while it still contains some characteristic self - indulgence , mrs . doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly - laugh comedy served up with high energy . williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda ' s ad for an afternoon housekeeper . he turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65 - year - old englishwoman . daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda ' s flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best . mrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that ' s instantly believable . it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman ' s dorothy michaels look like milton berle . more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it ' s a bit hard to swallow that she doesn ' t recognize any of the voices as her husband ' s . perhaps the biggest contrivance we ' re asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . there ' s more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . during the film , i was generally too busy laughing . after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams ' riffing , mrs . doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place . daniel ' s frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire ' s success goes to robin williams . it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn ' t just robin williams with a different name . he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul - mouthed . wisely , he never aims for saintly . his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . it ' s one of mrs . doubtfire ' s charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . as miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . the children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . it ' s easy to see mrs . doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it ' s true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . but mrs . doubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge ' s decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda ' s relationship . there ' s nothing dazzlingly new in mrs . doubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . and it ' s nice to see robin williams just act for a change .",pos,' ve never be member robin william fan club little bit improvisationaly schtick go long way sometimes feel ' m watch year old class clown film william have often try balance mania touchy feely emotion lead wildly uneven performance mrs doubtfire seem ready make same problem instead prove be william good comic screen project yet still contain characteristic self indulgence mrs doubtfire be nonetheless engaging belly laugh comedy serve high energy william star daniel hillard cartoon voiceover artist penchant irresponsible behavior such incident prove too many wife miranda sally field file divorce unemployed live disastrously unkempt apartment face limited time beloved child daniel decide respond miranda s ad afternoon housekeeper turn brother frank harvey fierstein theatrical makeup artist emerge euphegenia doubtfire matronly year old englishwoman daniel use access house keep eye miranda flirtation wealthy client pierce brosnan spend time child learn responsible parenting while try keep identity hide people know well mrs doubtfire have overcome mountain implausibility work basically do so most crucial be one family recognize daniel thank fantastic special makeup instantly believable be most convincing transformation ever commit film make dustin hoffman dorothy michael look milton berle more problematic be series call daniel make miranda pose nanny hell ' s bit hard swallow doesn t recognize voice husband s perhaps big contrivance ' re ask swallow be daniel make quick change mrs doubtfire few minute ' s more realistic makeup slap latex mask fortunately be inconsistency only attract attention credit roll film be generally too busy laugh get slow start involve too much william riffing mrs doubtfire kick high gear wig pad be place daniel frantic attempt fool court officer be wonderful be climactic restaurant sequence even see resolution come mile away clearly most credit doubtfire success go robin william take put drag play comic character t just robin william different name thoroughly inhabit euphegenia doubtfire seem relish scene get play blunt foul mouthed wisely never aim saintly response intrusion new suitor stu be often petty kind thing most do benefit anonymity ' mrs doubtfire s charm daniel miranda be perfect just people try be well miranda sally field be solid background role pierce brosnan be nicely understate stu child be also good mara wilson be almost oppressively cute young support player merely step aside allow william do thing ' easy see mrs doubtfire as little more tootsie warm ' s true be broad theme specific detail common mrs doubtfire manage carve own space particularly surprisingly honest moment involve judge decision ultimate status daniel miranda s relationship ' dazzlingly new mrs doubtfire be plenty laugh good comedy be always short supply ' s nice see robin william just act change

devil in a blue dress ===================== the comparisons to chinatown are easy enough , except for the fact that this film isn ' t nearly as gripping . writer / director carl franklin ( one false move ) is the force behind this accomplished - but - stiff adaptation of walter mosley ' s crime novel . denzel washington is as sturdy as ever , but he ' s burdened with a miscast supporting cast . tom sizemore and scene - stealer don cheadle are both fine . the problems start with jennifer beales , who never registers as the plot ' s femme fatale . she ' s a pretty face and nothing more . also underweight are maury chaykin and terry kinney . they play opposing mayoral candidates in 1948 los angeles and neither actor commands enough authority to stifle giggles . john huston , we miss you ! fine period detail and a strong sense of humor are a plus . they help to overcome a pace that ' s too polite for mosley ' s jazzy , swingin ' story . steal big , steal little ======================= i can ' t say much about this one . director andrew davis follows the fugitive with a wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers ( andy garcia ) with opposing moral codes . they ' re fighting over their adoptive mother ' s estate , a 40 , 000 - acre ranch worth millions and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers . so many different plots are trying to come together -- feuding brothers , reconciling husbands , loan - shark hired hitmen -- that you have to admire the director ' s ambition . too bad that almost every single person or plot - line is out of sync . that is , with the exception of alan arkin . he ' s the best thing in a movie that -- despite the work of four credited writers -- * still * manages to waste such diverse talents as david odgen stiers , kevin mccarthy , and joe pantolinao . and what the heck does that title mean ?",neg,have really be decade walter matthau coach bad news bear year mighty duck later formula be still go strong police academy graduate steve guttenberg star small town deputy sheriff corral co - coach school hastily form soccer team partner crime be new british exchange teacher olivia d abo lively lass have obviously see dangerous mind know good way gain respect disintereste outer city audience be teach neat soccer most good natured gag be fast motion variety such runaway cow control lawnmower kid laugh occasional belching bit parent peacefully doze other let support character name newt go unscathed s miss big green be well integration music comedy instead peppy pop score arguably work well effect most action be set bombastic orchestral score belong somewhere else comedy need music just watch old bug bunny short marx brother know mel brook know unfortunately current trend be overscore lush string booming brass scene moment remember simple strain bizet habanera original bad news bear day ' s usually bellow fanfare threaten smother scene path much add frost already frost cake awfully big adventure reteaming director mike newell star hugh grant be about as far remove get lightsome comedy wedding funeral second collaboration be downbeat theatrical drama young intern georgina cate struggle survive post - w liverpool hugh play gay director extremely unappealing character alienate fan be leave nonsense month bleak make up thick accent conspire make difficult story settle awful adventure be reward peter pan subtext be intriguing be diverse ensemble cast include peter firth alan rickman prunella scale basil devil blue dress comparison chinatown be easy enough fact film t nearly gripping writer director carl franklin false move be force accomplish stiff adaptation walter mosley crime novel denzel washington be as sturdy ever ' s burden miscast support cast tom sizemore scene stealer don cheadle be fine problem start jennifer beale never register plot femme fatale ' s pretty face more also underweight be maury chaykin terry kinney play oppose mayoral candidate los angele actor command enough authority stifle giggle john huston miss fine period detail strong sense humor be plus help overcome pace s too polite mosley jazzy swingin story steal big steal little ' t say much one director andrew davis follow fugitive wildly unfunny farce twin brother andy garcia oppose moral code ' re fight adoptive mother s estate acre ranch worth million support dozen migrant farm worker so many different plot be try come together feud brother reconcile husband loan shark hire hitman have admire director ambition too bad almost single person plot line be sync that is exception alan arkin ' s good thing movie work credited writer still manage waste such diverse talent david odgen stier mccarthy joe pantolinao heck do title mean
76,"one never quite knows what one is going to get with a mamet film . his american buffalo is a set - bound piece that has very little plot . sometimes he will tell a story that really moves . heist is mamet doing his most entertaining work . unlike his the spanish prisoner , there are no lapses in credibility . heist is probably the best mamet thriller since house of games . it is the kind of plot with which you are never sure who will double - cross whom , and frequently it is mamet double - crossing the viewer . watching the film ' s team getting around security the viewer is frequently asking himself either "" what the heck are they doing ? "" or "" why didn ' t anybody think of that before ? "" appropriately enough heist opens with a very clever jewelry store job . it is so clever that one wonders if mamet really thinks up all these ideas himself or if he has help from professional magician and con expert ricky jay , now a regular actor in mamet films . this is a robbery that works like a well - oiled machine . there is just one problem and it is enough to get joe moore ( played by gene hackman ) filmed on a security camera . now joe has to get out of the business . it was coming time anyway . joe ' s team including bobby blane ( delroy lindo ) , fran moor ( rebecca pidgeon ) , and pinky pincus ( ricky jay ) is going to split up and go separate ways . but crime boss bergman ( danny devito ) is pulling the strings and he says that joe and his people have to manage one more robbery . and he has to take along a young kid , the short - fused jimmy silk ( sam rockwell ) . immediately it is obvious that there is more going on than meets the eye . much of what distinguishes heist is mamet ' s dialog . remarkably it serves a double purpose . the robbery team sounds at once very professional and at the same time it has mamet ' s special feel for dialog . hackman has lines like "" everybody needs money . that ' s why they call it money . "" mamet ' s timing is perfect in the direction but terrible in the production . the plot is coincidentally a lot like the plot of the recent the score , which is , in fact , a very similar story . both are good films , perhaps for some of the same reasons . but at least on a high level they are much the same story . the other problem with the timing of heist is that it involves airport security and clever ways to get around them . i saw the film at the toronto international film festival on september 12 , 2001 . that made the subject matter just a little too timely . my understanding is that the release will be delayed . my biggest problem with the film is that rebecca pidgeon ' s acting at times seems very poor . it is some kind of mamet trademark i do not understand to have women talk without inflection , as if they are just reading the words for the first time . it is an irritation and distracts us from what is otherwise a very good thriller . it is one i rate an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high + 2 on the - 4 to + 4 scale .",pos,one never quite know be go get mamet film american buffalo be set bind piece have very little plot sometimes tell story really move heist be mamet do most entertaining work spanish prisoner be lapse credibility heist be probably good mamet thriller house game be kind plot be never sure double cross frequently be mamet double cross viewer watch film team get security viewer be frequently ask heck be do why t think before appropriately enough heist open very clever jewelry store job be so clever wonder really think idea have help professional magician con expert ricky jay now regular actor mamet film be robbery work well oil machine be just problem be enough get joe moore play gene hackman film security camera now joe have get business be come time anyway joe team include bobby blane delroy lindo fran moor rebecca pidgeon pinky pincus ricky jay be go split go separate way crime boss bergman danny devito be pull string say joe people have manage more robbery have take young kid short fuse jimmy silk sam rockwell immediately be obvious be more go meet eye much distinguish heist be dialog remarkably serve double purpose robbery team sound once very professional same time have mamet special feel dialog hackman have line need money s why call money timing be perfect direction terrible production plot be coincidentally lot plot recent score be fact very similar story be good film perhaps same reason least high level be much same story other problem timing heist be involve airport security clever way get see film toronto international film festival september make subject matter just little too timely understanding be release be delay big problem film be rebecca pidgeon act time seem very poor be kind mamet trademark do understand have woman talk inflection be just read word first time be irritation distract be otherwise very good thriller be rate scale high + scale
77,"overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name ( based on shirley jackson ' s novel "" the haunting of hill house "" ) stars lili taylor as one of three "" lab rats "" that participate in a supposed "" insomnia "" study being initiated by liam neeson . he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it . he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of "" creepy "" cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience ' s patience . i know this question has been posed before , but why do people keep remaking good movies ? the original was a great psychological horror film . this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary . in fact , i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg - 13 horror movie that is scary . unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening , then there ' s nothing in this film that will raise hackles . i nearly fell asleep twice during the film , and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn ' t seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed . it ' s sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly . owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house , and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability . catherine zeta - jones ( always nice to look at ) is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi - sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs . liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what ' s going on as the rest of them do . finally , poor lili taylor , the center of the film , gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her . apparently , a subplot involving a tryst between zeta - jones and taylor ' s characters was filmed but removed . that ' s too bad , because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative . this is jan de bont ' s second straight misfire ( speed 2 : cruise control being the first ) . when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better ? robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that . one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset . if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything , it would have served to make the film terrifying . what our mind fashions on it ' s own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything . apparently , yet another version of this story is being filmed under it ' s original title . i certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bont ' s version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had .

78,"* * * be warned . . . the following review contains some harsh language * * * the blair witch project . quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time . if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace , because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy . my colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more , then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more . and this worked for him . well , i ' m sorry , but nothing . . . is nothing ! ! ! ! ! nothing is not more . it ' s nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ! ! ! ! ! ! . i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing . "" nothing "" is free , available all around the world at a location near you . i am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary . i could just discount them and say , "" well , i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow . "" but i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn ' t hold water . there must be some other reason . ( then again , maybe my first thought is correct , i think i ' ll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction . ) when i hear people praising this film , i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97 % of this movie : three kids bickering with each other about being lost . they only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time . this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout "" josh ! ! "" over and over . this film should not be called the blair witch project , it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost . . . and argue with each other . oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting "" josh ! ! "" . and if you thought that was scary , wait till you see a pile of rocks , and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs , oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear . oh yeah , and some goo on one of their backpacks . you ' ve never seen terror like this folks , and you don ' t want to . the chevy chase / goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film . ( for current films , i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience . ) this film is an example of marketing with no substance . the marketing was brilliant , and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film . they want this film to be good . and i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don ' t have anything else to praise . that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along , but this is not it . this film could have been so much better . just think , if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost , and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff . i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it . she was sold on this film . and then , at one point during it , she turned to me and asked ' . . . are we supposed to be scared by this ? ' . i ' ve heard one opinion that you "" have to use your imagination "" to create the fear in this movie . well , i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do . use their imagination and create a good movie . i mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it . but even if you like this idea , then what are you imagining ? an entity called the blair witch ? some rednecks fucking with these kids ? are either of these things really scary when you think about it ? ? ? i ' ve heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something . well sure thats scary in real life , but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting . you could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary , but in a film it wouldn ' t be . and no , a movie does not need a big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy . actually the less the better ( see the equally awful remake of the haunting ) . but you have to do something . you cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary , if it were real . and by the way , about the shakycam filming in blair witch . aren ' t these supposed to be "" filmmakers "" who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly ? i ' m not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified , that ' s justified . i ' m talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can ' t seem to shoot anything smoothly at all . minor quibble there . there is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers . that the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank . and i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves "" what was i thinking ? ? "" . but , if they don ' t , then thats fine . if it works for them then that ' s okay i guess . i just lament that by making this movie a hit , we are going to be subjected to more of the "" nothing is more "" approach . pretty soon we ' re going to get some movies like this : just a still shot of a prison jail cell . for 90 minutes . and we ' ll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves , "" my god , wouldn ' t it be scary to spend life in prison ? ! ! this movie is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! ! !

79,"i swear i have seen the edge before . in fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . however , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . in doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker . unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . one surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . even horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . the river wild was one of the best action / suspense films i have seen from the 90s . the intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . the edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . i must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . this is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes ' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . the edge is pretty much a survival - of - the - fittest film . but taking scream ' s lead , the edge makes fun of the genre ' s cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . charles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . for once , we don ' t immediately care for the main character . instead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles ' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . charles ' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . as action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . soon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his "" personality . "" charles , bob , bob ' s assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . down the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . take , for instance , the entire man - hunting bear plot . this has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears . but given the charles ' intelligence , and bob ' s uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists . even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . my favorite line of the film comes from charles : "" most people die in the wilderness because they didn ' t do the one thing that could save their life . . . thinking . "" despite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn ' t as it seems anymore . i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . the first two - thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles ' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice . tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility . i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . thankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . but some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal . anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences ' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . baldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way . you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double -

80,"accepting his oscar as producer of this year ' s best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . one could almost say the same about his much - prized film . rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . in short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . the same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . juliette binoche ' s nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . with so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film ' s 160 minutes can be taxing . yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn ' t help but feel that greatness was in the air . hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern - day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . but ultimately the emotional truths writer - director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . in the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . bore is perhaps too strong a word . but after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half - full .",pos,accept oscar producer year good picture winner saul zaentz remark cup runneth almost say same much prize film rarely be screen so overflow potent imagery symbolism idea metaphor complex literate storytelling possess intelligence invite even demand constant scrutiny acuity perception observation somehow yield truth short antithesis thing hollywood surfeit signal be make serve rather pale thinly realize love story emotional impact be as dry desert wind ralph fienne be title character amnesiac burn victim gradual return memory particularly memory love be ostensible focus film use numerous flashback help put piece personal puzzle together never learn enough man feel much empathy emotional life story begin be essential clue remain withhold same easily be say other character film be too many juliette binoche s nurse come as close film get emotional heart least learn early on be scarred death close so understand why be eager escape company comrade order seek refuge convalescence mysterious disfigure die stranger even information be imparted so quickly such cursory fashion however verge comical so many character enjoy so little screen time film minute be tax be so captivating sensibility camera couldn t help feel greatness be air hint be everywhere man hate ownership want desperately possess lover ancient cave painting swimmer copy casually modern day swimmer sahara way shift sand time obliterate more completely world war be enough latent meaning supply college film student paper topic year ultimately emotional truth writer director anthony minghella be grasp be never reveal end be leave impression have witness oxymoron haunt bore bore be perhaps too strong word drink rich production value cup remain only slightly half full
81,"life is beautiful is a rare treat : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful , or , even worse , humorless . it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce , stirs in a little poignancy , and ends up a very enjoyable movie . it ' s an italian film , but don ' t let that discourage you . subtitle - phobes will be missing a wonderful experience . life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy , with the clownish , but good natured guido ( roberto benigni ) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle . the year is 1939 , and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams , dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . their romance seems to be picture perfect , with only one stumbling block : she ' s already engaged to another man . can guido overcome the odds and win his girl ? what do you think ? however , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy . the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives , which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue ( giorgio cantarini ) , who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp . unable to protect his boy in any other way , guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp . he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game , with points awarded for such tasks as hiding , being brave and being very very quiet . as you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them . as a romantic comedy , it is sweet and funny . as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair , it is touching . roberto benigni ' s work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin ' s , and it is easy to see why . he is able to run the gamut of comic expression , from slapstick to farce , with a warm - hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero ' s "" triumph of the underdog "" spirit . life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust . however , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears . with life is beautiful , benigni has created a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy . it ' s quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i ' ve had at the movies this year .",pos,life be beautiful be rare treat lighthearte comedy tackle very serious subject commit sin be disrespectful even bad humorless combine charming romance dash farce stir little poignancy end very enjoyable movie ' s italian film don t let discourage subtitle phobe be miss wonderful experience life be beautiful open sweet romantic comedy clownish good natured guido roberto benigni arrive rustic italian town work waiter uncle year be guido literally stumble girl dream dora nicoletta braschi romance seem be picture perfect only stumble block ' s already engage man guido overcome odd win girl do think however year later thing have take turn bad italy fascist have step race initiative be bad news jewish guido new son giosue giorgio cantarini be round ship concentration camp unable protect boy other way guido attempt shield young son horror labor camp pretend be elaborate game point award such task hide be brave be very very quiet tell description life be beautiful have very different tone manage excel romantic comedy be sweet funny bittersweet tale hope despair be touch roberto benigni work here have be compare good chaplin s be easy see why be able run gamut comic expression slapstick farce warm hearted feeling celebrate downtrodden hero triumph underdog spirit life be beautiful tread thin line when turn attention holocaust however be able successfully navigate minefield demean gravity horror involve lose humorous edge allow smile tear life be beautiful benigni have create triumphant bittersweet comedy ' s quite simply most enjoyable time ' ve have movie year
82,"i have never been so confused after watching a movie . "" meet joe black "" is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year , with a cinematography , music and cast that will dazzle most of us . at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season . at first you marvel at the elegant direction , graceful cinematography and sensual musical score . then you ' ll wait for something to happen for half an hour , but when you finally understand what ' s going on , you ' ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins , brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this ? the script is simply a silly and unresolved story , which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture . it feels like an eternity . most of the time it is a pompous soap opera , filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and "" meaningful "" winks . the film is based on alberto caesella ' s play "" death takes a holiday "" . the story concentrates around bill ( anthony hopkins ) who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man , but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying "" yes "" . soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen ( brad pitt ) who introduces himself as "" death "" . it is bill ' s time . but death has other plans . it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive . our bill is chosen to be death ' s guide and in exchange he gets time . bill introduces death as joe black , who immediately becomes the center of everyone ' s attention . bill ' s business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill ' s side , lives in his house and resides at his office . that is not all , however . bill ' s youngest daughter susan ( claire forlani ) falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her . this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences . it wouldn ' t be fair to say that this film didn ' t have some interesting moments , such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill ' s family for dinner . when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love , the experience is somewhat different . it is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure . it ' s one thing to say : "" wouldn ' t it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth . . "" to create a motion picture out of this is another . four screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic . it is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film . on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest ( "" scent of a woman "" ) . hopkins looks great in any role , and no matter how shallow or hollow it is , he will complete it . his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else , since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment . but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time . how can you play death in human form ? to me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters . they are not creatures , but phenomenas . saying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form . handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work . speaking in a calm , soft voice , portraying death as a lonely , distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters . he looks and acts more like an angel of death , rather than a demon or a red - eyed executioner . claire forlani and others are also fine , stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits . unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery . in other words this is not what i expected from the director of "" scent of a woman "" . it could ( and should ) be better with such cast and crew . in the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera .",neg,have never be so confused watch movie meet joe black be probably most visually satisfy film year cinematography music cast dazzle most same time be probably most boring ridiculous experience hat have season first marvel elegant direction graceful cinematography sensual musical score then ' wait happen hour when finally understand s go ' wonder be actor such anthony hopkin brad pitt claire forlani be do film script be simply silly unresolved story be artificially stretch hour long motion picture feel eternity most time be pompous soap opera fill empty dialogue actor deliver high pitched voice meaningful wink film be base alberto caesella play death take holiday story concentrate bill anthony hopkin live fulfil life successful business man sometimes wake middle night hear voice be say soon meet young elegant gentleman brad pitt introduce death be bill time death have other plan have come simple mortal find mean be alive bill be choose be death guide exchange get time bill introduce death joe black immediately become center attention bill business partner speculate why joe be constantly bill side live house reside office be however bill young daughter susan claire forlani fall love mysterious stranger joe fall love relationship be bind have serious consequence wouldn t be fair say film didn t have interesting moment such scene where joe be invite join bill family dinner when joe start enjoy peanut butter later fall love experience be somewhat different be obvious story story be very difficult structure ' thing say wouldn t be fun have death take human form come earth create motion picture be screenwriter have work script lack drive logic be overlong too primitive pass serious film other hand demonstrate incredible performance very decent direction martin brest scent woman hopkin look great role no matter how shallow hollow be complete talent charisma be need here more where else actually save film complete embarrassment pitt be one get most difficult role recent time how play death human form seem death life be be associate earthly matter be creature say death take human form be same suggest eternity take human form handle ridiculous task be incredibly difficult pitt deserve credit work speak calm soft voice portray death lonely distant powerful guy be unfamiliar practical earthly matter look act more angel death rather demon red eyed executioner claire forlani other be also fine stretch stereotypical character limit unfortunately performance be enough rescue film self inflict misery other word be expect director scent woman be well such cast crew end seem have be intensively work ravishingly look soap opera
83,"it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds . this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks ' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre ' s toilet paper . from this opening moment , one can infer shrek ' s defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney - esque fairy tale . although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye . while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community . the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world . the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way . their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone . shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey . courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey ' s immeasurable cowardice reveals itself . whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self - acknowledgment . but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire - breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage . he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them . secondly , upon shrek ' s and donkey ' s redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor . throughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona . an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona . children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his / her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist . after the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance . surprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night . in this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one ' s self . upon fiona ' s learning of shrek ' s desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self - ridicule and hatred . any child can pull from fiona ' s transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self - acceptance . on the technical side , shrek triumphs . directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters . these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona ) . myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , "" normal "" beings . murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high - strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen . cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess / ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack . while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s . h . schulman . the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer , combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike . capping it off with a constant tongue - in - cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features , the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers . with shrek , dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one - upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come . the smaller children will laugh and cheer ; the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not . a film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own , shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages .",pos,stand moment soon forget giant green ogre flip page cliche fairy tale narrate bit dull inspiration story hold lead believe serve prologue shrek dreamwork second computer animate feature pricelessly hilarious bit cinema page tale serve ogre toilet paper opening moment infer shrek defy expectation regard standard disney esque fairy tale rampant moment hilarity dot shrek true charm film lie bold element friendship courage acceptance excel outstanding direction stunning actor voice work most importantly witty screenplay more go meet eye shrek feature abundance humor relate directly adult positive friendship value aim young child fulfill storyline shrek previously mention ogre hold position absolute nothingness community jolly green giant meet fellow outsider know only donkey specie talk remain reluctant warm good portion time shrek eventually come mutual understanding acknowledge common state outcast world pair team retrieve princess fiona castle guard dragon powerful lord farquaad learn bit other way friendship exhibit core theme need lean exemplify child witness film act honest companion unquestionably affect shrek donkey endure suppose freak nature due only difference other cle other support guidance journey courage demonstrate major storyline journey rescue fiona donkey immeasurable cowardice reveal encounter walk shaky bridge live alone donkey withhold fear continuously put aside self acknowledgment yapping donkey face phobia when present giant fire breathing dragon guard fiona die terror triumph courage wisely choose courage pretend dangerous situation actually face allow donkey overcome horror likely only continue insistence secondly shrek s donkey redeem princess fiona ogre find princess have plan whomever save satisfy desire human knight shine armor storyline shrek face deep perpetual misgiving inhere ogre struggle determine how reveal true identity fiona ongoing struggle occur reluctance truth eventually shrek courageously conquer fear tell forbidden secret fiona child realize donkey shrek fear remain only as complicated make set mind overcome particular endless possibility exist friendship courage prevail central character heart shrek take more stretch development acceptance surprisingly fiona hold dark secret own spell cast year ago transform ogre night storyline learn hold acceptance realize beauty truly mean simply act self fiona learning shrek desire pursue relationship fiona know acceptance serve only platform love shrek work give inner demon self ridicule hatred child pull fiona transformation meaning beauty meaning self acceptance technical side shrek triumph director adam adamson vicky jenson pace shrek consistent satisfying manner evenly distribute lesson learn central character central character spring life thank brilliant voice work mike myer shrek eddie murphy donkey cameron diaz princess fiona myer create shrek lovable troubled ogre green color only serve skin color perhaps envy other normal being murphy succeed donkey recreate high string persona so many know actor have screen cameron diaz exude charisma innocence fiona give princess ogre sense power many female character animate film lack direction voice work certainly elevate shrek ultimate factor film succeed lie screenplay write te elliott terry rossio joe stillman roger h schulman script never underestimate intelligence viewer combine previously speak element humor adult child alike cap constant tongue cheek feel poke fun classic disney animate feature fresh entertaining screenplay deliver shrek dreamwork executive jeffrey katzenberg have certainly up create instant animate classic live age come small child laugh cheer adult laugh even hard leave understand much child do film break stereotype create definite standard own shrek certainly endure age

85,"the laserman : somehow the title of writer - director - producer peter wang ' s film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman . you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips . as it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren ' t any superheroes . instead , wang ' s film is populated by a group of refreshingly off - beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city . the laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity . the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese - american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment . he loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds . arthur ' s professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas . his personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives . in fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco - based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) . it ' s the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark . arthur ' s not - so - typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body . she has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce -- the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine . veteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process . she plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture . arthur ' s girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free - spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation . arthur ' s best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns . joey is married to arthur ' s jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house . arthur ' s 11 - year - old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is -- horror of horrors -- bad at math ! he finds it impossible to meet his father ' s lofty expectations . the various people in arthur ' s life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity . like wang ' s earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences . every character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity -- struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way . the movie also offers a provocative look at technology . wang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job . the film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers . wang raises the time - honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions . was einstein responsible for the a - bomb ? is arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? the movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw . according to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . ironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology -- the technology of filmmaking . wang ' s direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross - cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w . griffith . cinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee ' s films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look . mason daring ' s score , which includes a send - up of bach , is right on target . the laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it ' s sometimes ambitious to a fault . wang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it ' s hard to digest them all . for instance , one character ( arthur ' s sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don ' t care about her marital problems . in weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands . overall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction . on the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy - thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style . the heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film . you can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town .",pos,laserman somehow title writer director producer peter wang film conjure image superhero ultraman spiderman kind of expect adventure flick crime fighter shoot laser beam fingertip turn laserman be _ crime laser beam aren t superhero instead wang film be populate group refreshingly off beat character live ultimate cultural melting pot new york city laserman be comic brew celebrate ethnicity eccentricity electricity film tell bizarre story arthur weiss hayashi chinese american laser scientist life become incredibly hectic accidentally kill lab assistant experiment lose job find work mysterious company secretly plan use laser technology commit dastardly deed arthur professional life be cluttered moral dilemma personal life other hand be cluttered colorful friend quirky relative fact arthur be far bland character film charismatic performance hayashi san francisco base actor film include chan be miss karate kid ' s auxiliary character give laserman unique spark arthur s so typical jewish mother ruth example be convince chinese soul be trap jewish body have dye red hair black take herbal medicine daily be perpetually cook strange delicacy such matzo ball soy sauce ultimate fusion jewish chinese cuisine veteran stage actress joan copeland take part run almost steal movie process play ruth drive woman determine overcome genetic heritage immerse chinese culture arthur girlfriend janet maryann urbano be kooky free spirit rather meditate copulate ultimate goal be orgasm zen meditation arthur good friend joey tony leung be small time thief hustle microwave oven machine gun joey be married arthur jewish sister be also have affair chinese immigrant work whore house arthur year old son jimmy play amazingly adorable david chan be horror horror bad math find impossible meet father lofty expectation various people arthur life come together form rich tapestry humanity wang early film great wall san francisco family visit relative china laserman revolve cultural difference character film be way try find identity struggle negotiate balance native culture american way movie also offer provocative look technology wang appear movie lieutenant lu detective be feed machine even rely do job film view technology wary eye acknowledge necessity same time realize potential danger wang raise time honor question scientist be hold responsible invention be einstein responsible bomb be arthur weiss responsible laser movie pit spirituality technology man machine result be draw accord film technology have place employ great forethought caution ironically very nature laserman be triumph technology technology filmmake wang direction be exquisite especially tense finale director frantically cross - cut various subplot perhaps homage d griffith cinematographer ernest dickerson have work spike lee s film give laserman distinctive artistic look mason dare score include send up bach be right target laserman be ambitious endeavor be be applaud ' sometimes ambitious fault wang serve so many slice life film ' s hard digest instance character arthur sister have negligible screen time consequently just don t care marital problem weave web wang have include few too many strand overall however laserman be charmingly eclectic concoction surface film be light bouncy comedy thriller overflow whimsical humor visual style heavy issue emerge only when take deep look film ponder moral question just sit back enjoy absurdity life china town

87,"dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! regardless of what i say about knock off , you can ' t grasp its awfulness from my words . you have to see it and experience it for yourself . here ' s the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so . yes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . in fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story . don ' t get me wrong : i ' m not excusing knock off . it reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it ' s so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was . it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean - claude van damme . it does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . as i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness . now , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn ' t , but it ' s still a fascinating kind of mess . i don ' t like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i ' m off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . for the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing . i paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name - brand materials but are generic and cheap ) . i don ' t know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film . ray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there ' s no problem . rob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film . lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! in fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do . in that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense . but what a strange mess it is . it was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours . can this be the same man ? i don ' t see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . knock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there ' s no semblance here . for instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he ' s running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . why ? who knows . what are the implications of this ? i have no idea . most action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . knock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . the acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . sorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . van damme is bad , but he ' s charming in that bad way , and so i can ' t say that he ' s hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . the only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . they ' re all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner - workings of a knock off running shoe . but his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well - choreographed . lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes ' first encounter with the rochon character . but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ? i hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought . knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania . if it were boring , i ' d give it zero stars . but it ' s not boring : it ' s loud and excessive and completely incoherent . it ' s also funny , even when it isn ' t meaning to be funny . a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn ' t deserve to be fully lambasted . i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness , but i can ' t deny it ' s zany , useless charm . oh , i know , they ' re just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they ' re fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts . it ' s fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn ' t excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful .",neg,dear god be fantastically bad film regardless say knock ' t grasp awfulness word have see experience here s kicker though suggest do so be bad film easily most incompetent film year have certain misguided charm make unique kind disaster endure fact enjoy most brief running time dreadful acting completely incomprehensible story don t get wrong ' m excuse knock reach unacceptable level badness ' so incoherent wonder be hack worse avenger be also feature truly terrible performance lela rochon michael wong paul sorvino course jean claude van damme do however have entertaining presence rob schneider excessively inventive pretentious direction tsui hark watch occasionally wonder be aware own awfulness now retrospect seem clear wasn t ' s still fascinating kind mess don t write plot description be far most boring part write review case ' m hook be way write accurate synopsis knock sake comparison have trouble understand usual suspect first viewing pay close attention knock only thing be able say be van damme play dude name ray be accuse cia think sell knock product knock product be course product look name brand material be generic cheap don t know have do martial art be lot martial art film ray be good martial art when have beat bad guy s problem rob schneider play sidekick have idea really be end film lela rochon be just woman accuse stuff paul sorvino be good guy bad guy once fact character go so many shift good bad end provide absolutely insight really do order knock be completely incoherent make absolutely sense strange mess be be write stephen e souza also write die hard hour be same man don t see how course huge chunk film have be remove sake run time knock seem have interesting premise as far action film go ' s semblance here instance van damme be introduce then second later ' s run chariot race street hong kong why know be implication have idea most action film abandon depth favor action be normally problem knock however be first film have prefer see talky sequence cut acting be embarrassingly bad rochon particular deliver line stiff talentless insincerity sorvino addition deserve well van damme be bad ' charming bad way so t say ' s hard watch rarely understand be say only exception be rob schneider be actually quite funny lot time tsui utilize so many trick make john woo look tame comparison ' re pointless gimmick though such shot inner working knock run shoe action scene be never boring particular piece inside fruit factory fruit factory be well choreographed lot scene be pitch well comedy such hero first encounter rochon character do tsui know film be ludicrous hope do alternative be frightening thought knock have feel truly terrible exercise camp mania be boring ' give star ' s bore ' loud excessive completely incoherent ' s also funny even when isn t mean be funny bad film succeed entertainment doesn t deserve be fully lambaste recognize knock irrefutable badness ' t deny zany useless charm know ' re just action scene look desperately real story ' re fun action scene crowd laughably inane concept ' fun admire awfulness film doesn t excuse fact be indeed awful
88,"lean , mean , escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by . most are unnecessarily complicated , and others have no sense of expediency -- the thrill - ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot . perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive , which featured none of the flash - bang effects of today ' s market but rather a bread - and - butter , textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about . the latest tony scott movie , enemy of the state , doesn ' t make it to that level . it ' s a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers , without looking back . although director scott has made missteps in the past , such as the lame thriller the fan , he ' s generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun . that vibrant spirit is present here , shown in well - timed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed . enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography -- director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views , angles , lenses , and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie . enemy is truly a visual experience , and that ' s only one of the reasons it ' s such a fun watch . the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds ( jon voight ) . reynolds wants a new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment , but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee . reynolds has the senator offed , but not before the murder is caught on a naturalist ' s camera . by an extremist chain of events , the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean ( will smith ) ' s posession , and it ' s not long before he ' s running from reynolds ' cronies . it ' s only with the help of an ex - spook named brill ( gene hackman ) that dean is able to get to the bottom of things . the acting is top notch , and the three principles - smith , hackman , and voight - are generally more mature and excellent all around . smith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes a normal human being ; voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence ; and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role . smith ' s regular joe comes off particularly well , as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not . the supports are also in fine form , lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas . this is , for the holiday crowd , the hot ticket ; as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking .",pos,lean mean escapist thriller be tough product come by most be unnecessarily complicated other have sense expediency thrill ride effect get lose cumbersome plot perhaps ultimate escapist thriller be fugitive feature none flash bang effect today market rather bread butter textbook example clever script good direction be all late tony scott movie enemy state doesn t make level ' s true ninety product run grease lightning maze cell phone laptop computer look back director scott have make misstep past such lame thriller fan ' s generate good deal energy picture crimson tide top gun vibrant spirit be present here show well time carefully plan chase scene give movie aura sheer speed enemy state also feature unprecedented use amazing cinematography director photography daniel mindel throw staggering amount different view angle lense film stock audience go long way involve audience movie enemy be truly visual experience s only reason ' s fun watch movie light age senator visit nsa deputy chief thoma reynold jon voight reynold want new communication act pass allow government free reign use surveilance equipment senator plan bury bill committee reynold have senator off murder be catch naturalist s camera extremist chain event tape end labor lawyer robert dean smith s posession ' s long ' run reynold crony ' s only help ex - spook name brill gene hackman dean be able get bottom thing acting be top notch principle smith hackman voight be generally more mature excellent all around smith put aside wisecracking act become normal human being voight tone amount sneer put character great ominpotence hackman be simply top mysterioso role smith regular joe come particularly well run authortie reason know support be also fine form lend credibility main role advance plot key area be holiday crowd hot ticket as well look serving genuine action market be otherwise lacking
89,"in double jeopardy , the stakes are high . think of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy , and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker . the finished product , although able to maintain the viewer ' s attention , is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script . ` alex , i ' ll take homicide for $ 400 . . . ' libby parsons ( ashley judd ) is a happily married mom leading a normal life . one night , her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her out for a romantic escape on a sailboat . libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared . she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck , where she handles a fallen knife ( like any stupid character ) and is spotted by the coast guard , who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening . nick is presumed dead , and although she pleads her innocence , libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband . now , please don ' t think i ' m spoiling any vital plot details , because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans . if you haven ' t seen this preview , don ' t read any further . but seriously , the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas s . cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters . during the most vital scenes in the movie , i was anticipating every twist or ` surprise ' that eventually popped up on the screen . i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals . most , unfortunately , will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production . one is tommy lee jones , who plays travis lehman , a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison . jones is always wonderful as an authority figure , and he ' s certainly familiar with this sort of role ( as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals ) . judd , as a likable heroin with gusto , also has a chance to flex her acting abilities . while emotionally unconvincing , the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role , perking up the movie like an injection of anti - depressant . the actors , and their relationship together , present the one - two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely . and now , back to the plot . while behind bars , libby learns an interesting little bit of information : a person can ' t be convicted of the same crime twice . this law , called ` double jeopardy ' , could be her motive for hunting down her husband . . . who may still be alive . yes , you heard right . the movie degenerates into a cross - country chase , where everything you expect to happen . . . does . the final scenes , which could have redeemed the film , are poorly handled by director bruce beresford - whose previous work centers highly around drama ( driving miss daisy , paradise road ) . ironically , it is those elements - like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son - that don ' t quite work here . at least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars . unfortunately , jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive , and the real depth of his character is only skin deep . but he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material , and both have some memorable comic moments . judd , in particular , has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her ` parole officer ' . hmmm . . . perhaps this would have made a good comedy . it is disappointing , because there are the makings of a competent action film here . it ' s nicely shot and choreographed in downtown vancouver , and will entertain those who aren ' t turned off by the woeful story - line . ?

90,"the year is barely a week old , and there is already a candidate for the worst of 1997 -- the relic , a would - be chiller that ' s more successful at making the audience laugh than scream . in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams ( whose last two pictures were dreadful jean - claude van damme vehicles ) , a creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses ( hypothalamii ? ) of humans and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum . how did this creature come into existence , and why does it feed on hormones ? the "" scientific "" explanation cooked up by the four -- yes , four -- credited screenwriters ( amy holden jones , john raffo , rick jaffa , and amanda silver ) takes "" suspension of disbelief "" to new heights , even by monster movie standards . but as cockamamie as the science is in the film , it isn ' t quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics . miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination , turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip , complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears . give it up , penelope -- it ' s a _monster_movie_ . on the flip side , tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant , but his role is so thankless that it ' s hard to imagine it being played any more effectively . it ' s quite funny to see a film indulge , with the straightest of faces , in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well ( and so recently ) in scream . for example , in one early scene , a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night . ok , we all know what ' s coming , but as if we didn ' t need any more confirmation , he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away . everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie . and later , miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing . does she make a beeline for the front door ? of course not -- she runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall . with all the cliches , it is only fitting the film ' s climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film : that of someone outrunning a fireball . if the relic is truly "" the next evolution in terror "" as the poster states , then the horror film -- and humanity -- is in even worse shape than we thought .",neg,year be barely week old be already candidate bad relic be chiller s more successful make audience laugh scream ridiculous film uberhack peter hyam last picture be dreadful jean claude van damme vehicle creature feed hypothalamus hypothalamii human animal go killing spree chicago museum how do creature come existence why do feed hormone scientific explanation cook credited screenwriter amy holden jones john raffo rick jaffa amanda silver take suspension disbelief new height even monster movie standard as cockamamie science be film isn t quite as hard swallow casting clueless penelope miller brilliant molecular biologist specialize evolutionary genetic miller act want oscar nomination turn scene require slight display emotion overblown oscar clip complete pierce wail glycerine tear give penelope ' s _ monster_movie _ flip side tom sizemore just phone performance police lieutenant role be so thankless ' s hard imagine be play more effectively ' s quite funny see film indulge straightest face cheesy horror movie cliche we craven lampoon so well so recently scream example early scene museum security guard go bathroom stall late night know s come didn t need more confirmation pull joint start puff away know happen people do drug scary movie later miller frantically run museum exhibit hear suspicious heavy breathing do make beeline front door course run lady room cower stall cliche be only fit film climax offer be perhaps most overused recent film outrun fireball relic be truly next evolution terror poster state then horror film humanity be even bad shape think
91,"some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled , making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen . i finished mike figgis ' "" leaving las vegas "" hours ago , and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr . alot of people refer to this film as "" that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude "" . "" leaving las vegas "" is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are : a drunk and a whore . ben ( nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years ) is the drunk . his family and friends have long since abandon him , and all he has left is his liquor . in a scene early in the film , we see ben staggering into a resteraunt , looking for a "" friend "" of his to mooch some money off of . he finds the guy ( richard lewis ) having dinner with a buddy and two chicks , trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid . when ben approaches the table , you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable . after lewis gives ben the money , he coldly says "" i think it would be best if you didn ' t contact me again . "" now even though through the course of the film , some much more depressing things happen , this is when i felt the most for ben . there was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face , ( not to sound hokey or anything ) it almost brought a tear to my eye . it turns out that ben was once a semi - successful hollywood player , and apparently a pretty popular guy . now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women , not so much for the sex , but for the company ; for someone to talk to or spend time with . once he is fired from his job , ben decides to burn all his belongings , collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death . one night he runs into a prostitute ( a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue - how far she has come since "" adventures in babysitting "" ) named sera . she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp , a scumbag who gets - off by cutting her . they are both very lonely , self - destructive people . they immediatly hit it off , both of them realizing that they need one another . and it isn ' t even a sexual relationship . they don ' t even have sex until , like , the last ten minutes of the film . "" leaving las vegas "" is not a film about plot . with the exception of what i have already revealed ( which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so , by the way ) , there isn ' t too much of a story to it . it is more a film about people and how they react to one another . from what i can see , this is basically a perfect film . the direction is great ( with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody , smokey atmosphere of a film noir ) and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s , or any other decade for that matter . but don ' t go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what you ' re getting yourself into . first off , if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge , stay away from "" leaving las vegas "" . it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms , rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon ( that ' s right ) . secondly , if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film , don ' t see it . however , if you are cool with those two things , you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have .",pos,movie have impact linger mind long credit have roll make think carefully recollect have just see finish mike figgis leave las vegas hour ago be still haunt when hit rewind vcr alot people refer film flick where nick cage play alcoholic dude leave las vegas be so much movie alcoholism be story people other be drunk whore ben nicolas cage possibly good male performance past year be drunk family friend have long abandon have leave be liquor scene early film see ben stagger resteraunt look friend mooch money find guy richard lewis have dinner buddy chick try crack witty joke just come stupid when ben approach table clearly sense immediatly feel uncomfortable lewis give ben money coldly say think be good didn t contact again now even course film much more depressing thing happen be when feel most ben be look sorrow dispare face sound hokey almost bring tear eye turn ben be once semi - successful hollywood player apparently pretty popular guy now spend time get rob hooker try desperatly pick woman so much sex company talk spend time be fire job ben decide burn belonging collect cash relocate las vegas slowly drink death night run prostitute brilliant performance elizabeth shue how far have come adventure babysitte name sera be involve abusive relationship pimp scumbag get off cut be very lonely self destructive people immediatly hit realize need one isn t even sexual relationship don t even have sex last minute film leave las vegas be film plot exception have already reveal happen first minute so way isn t too much story be more film people how react see be basically perfect film direction be great mike figgis do brilliant mix glamor las vegas moody smokey atmosphere film noir contain good performance come 90 other decade matter don t go rush see movie know ' get first off be easily offend frank sexual dialouge stay away leave las vegas be fill lengthy discussion orgasm rape various form perverted activity involve burbon s right secondly be mood see very depressing film don t see however be cool thing be most memorable experience ever have
92,"while watching "" shallow grave , "" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens ' "" blood simple . "" both are good films in which several characters , none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil , indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes . the body count rises , and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands . both films are also flawed , but for different reasons . "" blood simple "" is unrelentingly dark and moody , but its characterizations were a little hollow . "" shallow grave , "" on the other hand , is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes , and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they ' d accomplished for a more standard , audience - pleasing ending . the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time , yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end . as the film begins , we are introduced to alex ( ewan mcgregor ) , juliet ( kerry fox ) , and david ( christopher eccleston ) , a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow . they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious , but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch . a man named hugo moves into the apartment ' s remaining vacancy , and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose . juliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash ( presumably from criminal activities ) . the three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death ; after a drawing of straws , the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david , who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning . all of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film , and part of what makes "" shallow grave "" so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next . other than the obvious question of why they don ' t report the death and simply hide the cash , which is not addressed , the plotting and characterization , while sometimes predictable , worked in a way that kept my attention and , on more than one occasion , gave me chills . i will , therefore , attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn ' t give away too much of the plot . broadly , the trio are in danger due to hugo ' s underworld connections , as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process . a police inspector ( ken stott ) is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment , asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective . david , meanwhile , becomes increasingly paranoid , moves into the attic , and develops an affinity for sharp objects . director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment , and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other . while i do not consider myself the "" happy endings are automatically stupid "" type , i thought that "" shallow grave "" really should have ended in tragedy - a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison , in the mental hospital , or in the morgue . this could have been accomplished , quite credibly , but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional "" caper "" ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom , and nothing more . granted , this isn ' t really a "" happy "" ending , but it ' s still pretty light - hearted compared to what preceded it . i really shouldn ' t say anything more about the ending as far as details go , but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable . yes , this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes , but ultimately it left me feeling as if i ' d been cheated . still , "" shallow grave "" was brilliant most of the way through , and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller , and i am therefore awarding it three stars . i guess i just can ' t help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away .",pos,watch shallow grave find periodically notice thematic similarity coen blood simple be good film several character none be most conscientious have walk earth still be really evil indulge act deception soon necessitate more serious crime body count rise long seemingly normal people have blood hand film be also flawed different reason blood simple be unrelentingly dark moody characterization be little hollow shallow grave other hand be nearly flawless hour minute then filmmaker throw away much ' accomplish more standard audience please ending event film be sufficiently intense disturb honestly feel quite trouble be witness screen most time be slight grin face end film begin be introduce alex ewan mcgregor juliet kerry fox david christopher eccleston scottish trio live apartment glasgow be all sarcastic occasionally obnoxious other seem fairly normal bunch man name hugo move apartment remain vacancy next morning be find dead drug overdose juliet be about call police when alex discover hugo have bring suitcase fill brim cash presumably criminal activity eventually decide keep money cover death drawing straw particularly unenviable task mutilate body make unidentifiable bury fall david have be most reluctant partake scheme beginning transpire first minute so film part make shallow grave so brilliant while be honestly have idea be come next other obvious question why don t report death simply hide cash be address plotting characterization sometimes predictable work way keep attention more occasion give chill therefore attempt continue review way doesn t give too much plot broadly trio be danger hugo underworld connection goon search money kill several people process police inspector ken stott be clearly suspicious visit apartment ask pointed question try unnerve suspect exchange banal weirdly humorous bit dialogue junior detective david meanwhile become increasingly paranoid move attic develop affinity sharp object director danny boyle effectively create atmosphere mount tension suspicion apartment finally seem ready turn other do consider happy ending be automatically stupid type think shallow grave really have end tragedy realistic analysis story last minute film indicate character be probably about end prison mental hospital morgue have be accomplish quite credibly then boyle screenwriter john hodge seem flinch opt more conventional caper end get kick see outsmart more grant isn t really happy ending ' s still pretty light hearted compare precede really shouldn t say more ending as far detail go let add seem only shallow lazy also inconsistent rest film very believable ending make crack smile couple minute ultimately leave feel ' be cheat still shallow grave be brilliant most way through do at least meet minimum requirement entertaining thriller be therefore award star guess just t help think fourth star boyle hodge let slip away
93,"' bicentennial man ' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment . chris columbus , the director who gave you "" mrs . doubtfire "" , plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point . based on the short story by isaac asimov , it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human , which as you can imagine is very difficult . starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children . soon this robot , called andrew ( robin williams ) shows abilities that makes his owner mr . martin ( sam neill ) very curious . andrew is interested in art and music , he "" enjoys "" making clocks , which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions . it shows out that because of a small failure in the "" electrical circuits "" and "" positronic brain "" andrew has accidentally gained a soul . this makes him unique and his evil creators worried . then mr . martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn ' t programmed to do . soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom , destiny and love . this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner , a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction . ever since that film , the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy . what makes us human ? the thoughts ? the emotions ? is it possible to become human ? at what point can we say to a robot "" now you are one of us "" ? these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach . it is obvious that columbus didn ' t take them very seriously . when you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question "" when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? "" , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding . andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being , and only the society has troubles with it . in other words , it is as far from reality as from the academy awards . further more , there are other annoying problems . to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now . this has not been done for obvious reasons , because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task . columbus is the first to have crossed that line . the result is , as you might imagine , primitive , unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort . the world is simply frozen in time . neither the society , fashion , culture or values have changed over 200 years . mom is still working at the kitchen , doing the dishes . when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today , you ' ll see a slightly bigger difference . i am not saying that everything should change . it is unlikely that the human rights will change , but it ' s even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science , technology and fashion . i suppose it ' s possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale , but it ' s really hard . robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way . as always he does a decent job , as does sam neill . but it doesn ' t really matter . it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience . pretty much like last year ' s "" meet joe black "" , this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn ' t deserve . great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten . when isaac asimov wrote this story , the future seemed far away and magical . everything seemed possible . now is the future of asimov ' s time , and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago . for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne ' s "" 20 000 leagues under the sea "" , so can ' t we accept this story as a potential reality . let us hope that next year ' s "" a . i .

94,"no humans were harmed , tested or tasted in the making of this film . all recipes are fictions . twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism . a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ! director / writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves . . "" . . they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive . . "" this true story , briefly mentioned in "" the shining "" , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture . in 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold - starved americans making their way west . it was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could . capt . john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a "" hero "" and a victim during this period of relentless consumption . . . in ways he could never have imagined . boyd ' s journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican - american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california . upon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort ' s personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn ' t like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no - nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously "" over - medicated "" cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions . into this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half - starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound . seeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another . colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d ' oeuvre himself . our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out . soon it becomes clear that colqhoun ' s tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive . it involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person ' s strength , spirit and very essence . his hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes . there can never be enough , and death is the only escape . . it ' s all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through . as professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this . teen - age horror fans won ' t care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell . older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit , but they ' ll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces . but jokes aside , this is a film that is well worth watching . it has wonderful and mature characters , that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end . the two main characters are also the most interesting . boyd is a simple , honest man tiered of war , killing and fear . his sacred wish is to live a normal , quite life away from gunpowder and blood . colqhoun is different . he proves that a man , on the brink of death , would do anything to stay alive , including sacrificing his own soul . he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically . it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen . the atmosphere in "" ravenous "" is macabre and bizarre , scary and surreal . completely isolated from the rest of the world , stands fort spencer . here time stands still , and nothing changes . the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage . they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished -- men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life . men that are nothing , and has nothing to loose . the result is some sort of cabin fever . cannibalism is more like a sick game for them . since they find no pleasure in living , they find some excitement in killing and dying . it ' s like "" who ' s going to die first ? "" the unchangeable icy landscape , where birds do not sing and even wind doesn ' t move the leaves on the trees , resembles kubrick ' s "" the shining "" . it ' s hard to not get mad here ! one of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters , and starts to understand them , although they have turned into half crazed killers . music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere . a strange musical score , composed by michael nyman ( the piano ) and damon albarn , that often seems out of place , and in complete contrast to the image , somehow reflects the characters ' twisted reactions on the world and their situation . the director herself stated that it was "" ok to laugh "" during the picture . and i must admit that it is often very funny , in a strange way ( such as the wonderful quote : "" . . it ' s lonely being a cannibal . you don ' t get that many friends . . . "" or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin , saying "" eat to live . don ' t live to eat . "" ) . but mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change . every actor does a great job . especially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal , and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier , nagged by his undeserved honor . this strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordan ' s ' interview with the vampire ' . actually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies , since the topics are so alike .

95,"the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate . people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future . after a sort of confusing bit involving fake - looking cyborg things , the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds . the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth . the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element . the plot in this movie really isn ' t that important to the thing though . this movie has very good special effects , for the most part . the techno - ish music in the background fits the mood very well . bruce willis is an illegal taxi - cab driver in a futuristic new york city . one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk . this movie is about what happens . the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations . also there is a fair bit of action in the film , particularly towards the end . some characters are just plain strange including a highly - energetic deejay in drag . bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does . the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down . it is one of those sci - fi films where you ' ll be saying "" cool "" followed by a "" what the hell ? ! ? !

96,"when walt disney pictures announced a live - action feature based on the ' 60s cartoon series of "" mr . magoo , "" special interests groups representing the vision - impaired let out a cry of dismay . mr . magoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented . in fact , they were wrong . mr . magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near - blind , it ' s an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity . it ' s stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas . look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you ' ll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr . magoo . the best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining . the worst , mr . magoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be . the first problem with mr . magoo is the script . despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr . magoo is comically barren . from beginning to end , there ' s not a laugh to be found . every attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud . you ' d think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that ' s not the case . i ' ve had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures . then there ' s leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus ) . in the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun . lately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr . magoo . even if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we ' re reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but "" top form "" is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here . this is strictly a take - the - money - and - run operation . the story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber . the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often . the bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts - type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed ) . matt keeslar portrays one of magoo ' s sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo . the bumbling man ' s other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus . most of mr . magoo ' s humor comes in the form of failed slapstick . the cartoon violence level in this film doesn ' t approach that of home alone 3 or flubber , but it ' s still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices . there ' s a non - violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr . bean ' s recent , similar misadventure , it doesn ' t hold up well . then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo ' s near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby . i ' m willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack . tong , a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market , has helmed several jackie chan movies , including first strike , rumble in the bronx , and supercop . his chief talent , that of choreographing martial arts fights , is wasted here ( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch ) . like john woo ( hard target ) and ringo lam ( maximum risk ) before him , it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream . it is worth noting that , unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under - 10 crowd while driving parents to distraction , mr . magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages . the screening i attended was wall - to - wall kids , and , for the most part , they didn ' t seem to be enjoying themselves . when the film was over , i asked one little girl what she thought of it . her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words . mr . magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer , sight unseen .",neg,when walt disney picture announce live action feature base ' 60 cartoon series mr magoo special interest group represent vision impair let cry dismay mr magoo claim be insult man woman represent fact be wrong mr magoo be just insult blind near blind ' s insult human being have misfortune suffer dreadfully unfunny minute atrocity ' state obvious remark disney appear have run original idea look roster release ' see shocking list retread include dalmatian george jungle darn cat flubber now mr magoo good george jungle be mildly entertaining bad mr magoo expose just how painful bad movie experience be first problem mr magoo be script collaboration naked gun scribe pat proft mr magoo be comically barren begin end s laugh be find attempt humor be lot fall flat audible thud think dozen gag jam film least few work s case ' ve have more laugh ingmar bergman picture then leslie nielsen look sound act absolutely animated character memorably voice jim backus past nielsen have prove comic aptitude role movie airplane naked gun lately however have be get lazy take part like dracula dead love spy hard mr magoo even nielsen be top form take incredible stretch imagination see magoo especially ' re remind original short cartoon segment open close film top form be phrase use describe performance here be strictly take money run operation story many disney story be describe long sentence magoo be only witness theft rare jewel museum be try apprehend thief own police mistake robber cop be play ernie hudson stephen tobolowsky take lump early often bad guy be kelly lynch do lot martial art type kicking nick chinlund malcolm mcdowell have good sense look embarrassed matt keeslar portray magoo s sidekick nephew waldo bumble man other more interesting companion be dog name angus most mr magoo humor come form fail slapstick cartoon violence level film doesn t approach home alone flubber ' s still pretty acute character get hit head sledgehammer knock snowy precipice s non -

98,""" something is fishy in the state of universal . "" about ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post - apocalypse nitty - gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies . we ' ve always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on . to date , the most smoothly done were straightforward "" haircuts "" of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim . most of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane . ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget . ) now we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter . ( well , she ' s not a widow , and the kid isn ' t her daughter , but you get the idea . ) the lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn ' t given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script . the child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she outshines her material all the way through . in simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now . the polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet . the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies , and survive by trade , theft , or piracy . somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries , and its inhabitants , called "" smokers , "" are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials , so the bad guys have outboard engines , and fast - moving boats , airplanes , and jet skis . enola , found at sea as a young girl , has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back . we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical "" dryland , "" the place where trees , crops , and animals grow , and what plot there is hinges on who has enola . the psycho ruler of the smokers , the "" deacon , "" is trying to get her and find his way to dryland . played with typical self - lampooning , rug - chewing histrionics by dennis hopper , "" deacon "" is the only thing in the movie that ' s close to amusing . his performance is * almost * laughable , but there just isn ' t enough there to be funny . the star ( and a co - producer ) is kevin costner . he ' s playing an un - named lone denizen of the sea , a man called the "" mariner , "" who turns out to be a gilled , water - breathing mutant with webbed feet . very little is done with this . the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism ; it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted , much of the earth ' s surface would still be above water ; and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown .

99,"did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow . she is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder . the dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer ' s moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win . jeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history . he is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber . his remorse for his wife ' s comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980 . the background to the case is such . during christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke . the same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will . when examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood . claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail . he immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him . ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him . we follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn ' t commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn ' t figured out . dershowitz doesn ' t know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case . nevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him . together with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed . silver ' s performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film . schroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz . there are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical . yet , due to glenn close ' s troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well . the flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder doesn ' t fill in the blanks . the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending . the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion . the supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz ' s team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over - simplifies the story and the characters . yet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons . as von bulow , he is brutally evil . anti - semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame . irons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence . he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder . however , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility . there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife ' s death by years of neglect and coldness . however , legally , did he do the murder ? schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind . with all the character flaws , reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind . schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations , and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow , in death . for all the failed dramatic theatrics , this is one that works beautifully . we don ' t know what happened . that sense of legal ambiguousness , along with von bulow ' s obvious moral guilt , is why reversalf fortune works . in the end , von bulow is as sadistic as ever . irons is haunting , and that is why reversal of fortune is so good .",pos,do claus von bulow try kill wife sunny newport mansion be question reversal fortune ask consider open hospital ward comatose sunny von bulow be main narrator film narrative trick be extraordinarily risky schroeder dramatic trick work sunny von bulow narrate compelling story murder sex unhappiness lawyer moral dilemma take case think win jeremy iron be claus von bulow be fine role most devastingly evil performance history be as hate man alive as cold cucumber remorse wife comatose condition be nonexistant be wonder even child have difficulty accept version happen christmas background case be such christmas sunny von bulow fall deep coma recover awoke same situation occur only sunny never wake probably never when examine be find have time normal amount insulin blood claus von bulow be then accuse attempt murder stepson convict free bail immediately hire alan dershowitz renowe harvard law professor acquit ron silver be magnificent moral lawyer stand have happen follow very different case case johnson case where innocent kid be stand death row crime didn t commit von bulow still hasn t figure dershowitz doesn t know happen sunny be extremely hesitant take case nevertheless do base certain thing happen investigative process deeply upset together group law student dershowitz concoct defense ultimately get verdict reverse silver performance be handful solid role deep film schroeder direct many different level multiple plot line blend wonderfully mind alan dershowitz be flaw time film get overly theatrical glenn close troubled brutally honest performance sunny von bulow use comatose body narrator work here fairly well flashback be good time schroed doesn t fill blank movie have benefit increase attention certain development film have use well ending film progress wonderfully end suddenly intelligent conclusion support character be often neglect dershowitz team have be allow grow character wise schroed over simplifie story character flaw film be deeply engrossing iron von bulow be brutally evil anti - semitic prejudiced arrogant protective be rotten lie monster conviction have be wrong legally morally be blame iron play cold perfection pathetic attempt gain moral support claim innocence be adulterous liar cheat likelihood commit murder however genius reversal fortune come distinction moral culpability legal responsibility be doubt von bulow be responsible wife death year neglect coldness however legally do do murder schroeder dare viewer make own mind character flaw reversal fortune be engrossing puzzle be intelligent want viewer make own mind schroed taunt viewer contradictory revelation then mention answer compelling puzzle be reveal when join sunny von bulow death fail dramatic theatric be work beautifully don t know happen sense legal ambiguousness von bulow obvious moral guilt be why reversalf fortune work end von bulow be as sadistic ever iron be haunt be why reversal fortune be so good
100,"1992 ' s alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself -- box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979 ' s alien and 1986 ' s aliens , savaged david fincher ' s slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . hence , weaver , director jean - pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two - fold challenge -- not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once - profitable series from the scrap heap . despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . writer joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem -- clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . that done , the _real_ challenge presents itself -- what do with her . alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . what could be next ? whedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also "" infected "" with alien dna . so the new ripley is , indeed , new -- a human / alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . unfortunately , that is where alien resurrection ' s clever streak in writing stops . the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . while the settling into tried - and - true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried - and - true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . the alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . as technically adept as jeunet ' s direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon ' s ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self - awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . no , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott ' s alien or the even greater film that james cameron ' s aliens was . but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher ' s alien3 , jeunet ' s resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments .",pos,alien3 mark only death suicide popular protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver many way alien franchise box office receipt be anemic thank poor audience word mouth critic rally first installment alien alien savage david fincher slog sendoff include hence weaver director jean pierre jeunet other alien resurrection face - fold challenge only somehow resurrect ripley also rescue once profitable series scrap heap odd have succeed even entertaining new installment do measure excellent first writer joss whedon devise quick easy painless answer dead ripley problem clone be shady military scientist do use blood leave behind fiorina prison planet third film do _ real _ challenge present do alien introduce ripley smart resourceful alien simultaneously toughen make more vulnerable explore maternal side alien3 see undergo stage death be next whedon come clever spin original ripley die impregnate alien queen blood use clone be also infect alien dna so new ripley be indeed new human alien hybrid bless heightened instinct strength psychic bond deadly specie more predatory attitude unfortunately be where alien resurrection clever streak write stop alien series be know have strong story most creature feature story resurrection be more afterthought movie begin plot involve military type attempt train alien do bidding once creature break free be once again ripley ragtag crew time bunch interstellar smuggler include tough waif call play game winona ryder try exterminate alien ripley scenario be ultimately exploit full potential have like deep exploration quandary become specie have spend entire life try destroy settling try true formula be little disconcerting formula be try true reason jeunet tackle proceeding giddy abandon alien year be still terrify new breed be introduce be no less so violence be appropriately grisly extreme action set piece be suspenseful exciting most notably extended underwater sequence film be absolutely mesmerize visually thank solid work do production designer nigel phelp cinematographer darius khondji as technically adept jeunet direction be perhaps matter whedon great contribution be infusion humor notably downbeat serious series sense humor seem go horror show stand self awareness excess just add fun alien resurrection be great film ridley scott alien even great film jam cameron alien be dauntingly slow gloom doom fincher alien3 jeunet resurrection be welcome return root wild reckless thrill ride be make alien series so popular first place be keep series popular future installment
101,"synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage . ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan . ) in the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china . a girl ' s parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she ' s dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle . mulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father . ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph . the emperor wants to reward mulan ' s valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes . mulan ' s old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman . the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy ) . in disney ' s mulan , when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army . old mr . fa ( soon - tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming - na wen ) . fearing for her father ' s life , the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair , disguises herself as a man , and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father ' s stead . meanwhile mushu , the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family , has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner . ( his only duty is to ring a gong . ) mushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero . with the help of mushu , a horse , and a lucky cricket , can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family ? opinion : east meets west . i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors . from their state of the art animation studio in orlando , disney is hoping to work the same kind of east / west magic with mulan . i mean , what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art , with donny osmond singing , ming - na wen acting , and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson ? yet this is the case in the disney ' s re - interpretation of the familiar chinese classic . the end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney ' s best movies ever . personally , i ' m also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak - willed subservient asian woman take a beating : mulan is portrayed as a normal , if spirited , compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative . mulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney . kids of any age will like the family themes , and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing . and adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor , while the boys admire the battles . and adults can admire those male / female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family , honor , and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love , gumption , and questioning . but even the tiniest details reveal quality . the movie ' s art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces , positive detail , period clothing , and graphic designs typical of the time and place . computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 , 000 people , and a special program called ' attila ' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback . and singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game . balance is crucial . a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney ' s cup of tea , but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine , then , pow ! the dream team . by the same token , a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself , but toss the dragon in there and you ' ve got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp . it ' s rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west , old and young , male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole , but mulan hits the universal bullseye . it ' s movie for any age , creed , gender , or color .",pos,synopsis rumor be true person story mulan have circulate oral tradition year have inspire opera literature even coinage china have be issue annual gold silver coin set commemorate famous historical figure set include mulan ballad mulan write 5th 6th century imperial edict khan emperor order man family be draft army defend china girl s parent hear sighing think daughter mulan name mean magnolia be dream boy actually ' dread horror befall old infirm father be be draft battle mulan bravely run away masquerade boy serve army instead father mile year brutal war later army finally return triumph emperor want reward mulan valor prestigious position government decline accept horse return home quietly don true clothe mulan old army buddy visit get shock life when find mulan be actually woman disney animate feature mulan be similar ballad story only add modern character comic relief mushu dragon eddie murphy disney mulan when fierce army invade hun threaten overrun peaceful china emperor order man family be conscript army old mr fa soon be handicapped have son have only spirited young daughter mulan ming wen fear father life courageous mulan secretly cut hair disguise man sneak serve army father stead meanwhile mushu disgrace demoted guardian dragon fa family have be reduce size squirrel status incense burner only duty be ring gong mushu hit plan redeem regain guardian status help disguised mulan become macho male warrior hero help mushu horse lucky cricket army recruit mulan save china bring honor fa family opinion east meet west know chef santa do sort magic combine asian culinary influence west coast latin american down south european atlantic concoct new creation hit just right combination flavor state art animation studio orlando disney be hope work same kind east west magic mulan mean say tell new movie feature dynasty art donny osmond singing ming wen acting eddie murphy play chinese dragon make pop reference batman reverend jessie jackson be case disney s re - interpretation familiar chinese classic end result be spectacular mulan be disney good movie ever personally ' m also glad see detestable american stereotype weak willed subservient asian woman take beating mulan be portray normal spirited compassionate gal capable take initiative mulan be more just eastern graphic face combine westernize pop disney kid age like family theme understand good guy bad guy thing adolescent preteen girl appreciate romance factor boy admire battle adult admire male female nuance as well interplay traditional notion family honor duty industrial age notion romantic love gumption question even tiny detail reveal quality movie art supervisor spend week china research right look negative space positive detail period clothing graphic design typical time place computer be use crowd scene people special program call attila be use spectacular sequence involve attack hun horseback singer osmond salonga be top game balance be crucial movie chuckle lone dragon play eddie murphy be disney cup tea use character comic sidekick balance determined spirited heroine then pow dream team same token tale girl army be sober exercise filial piety toss dragon in there ' ve get enough wahoo individualism light hearted disney romp ' rare movie seamlessly combine element east west old young male female cohesive entertaining whole mulan hit universal bullseye ' movie age creed gender color

105,"mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival . as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival . it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . something else is what he did . the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life . she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep . meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada . she wants to build a career as an actress . betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow . she does not know who the woman is . she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is . they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not . meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own . he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) . these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong . there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion . in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits . a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun . lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film . he just chooses not to . as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason . there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches . the film is a little long for the subject matter . toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot . unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers . i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the - 4 to + 4 scale . mulholland drive spoiler warning . i have rated this film fairly low . you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film . david lynch is in large part a dark satirist . most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside . in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . the first 80 % of the film he tells a simple multi - thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . the audience expectation is that they will add up . but he has given clues that are self - contradictory . lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . mad magazine called it a poiuyt . other sources called it a tri - pronged u - bar . look at small portions of it and makes sense . look at the whole figure and it does not . this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri - pronged u - bar .",neg,mulholland drive do very well canne film festival see rating do do very well toronto international film festival be clear viewer why be so negative film most running time fact be interesting mystery story tell backdrop hollywood film industry end film think have be build fall apart film be be pilot tv series writer director david lynch do sell tv pilot think decide want do else else be do film open woman play laura harring be kill car when car crash save life crawl away accident concussion find bungalow unlocked door sleep meanwhile young vivacious betty watt arrive hollywood canada want build career actress betty be little surprised find woman sleep borrow bungalow do know woman be be even more surprised when woman awake do know be fix name rita be sure meanwhile local director adam justin theroux have problem own be try cast actress new film be get pressure producer crime figure cast else cammie rhode melissa george thread be join third be strange comic murder go terribly wrong be also strange character call cowboy monty montgomery add confusion be probably intend television pilot film open great vibrancy show dancing 60 style credit lot mulholland drive start fun lynch want know make enjoyable stylish film just choose david lynch film be strange material add little reason be earthworm be decidedly strange david lynch touch film be little long subject matter end get heavy violence sex scene clearly intend tv pilot unfortunately most important comment make film be spoiler mention main body review give mulholland drive scale low scale mulholland drive spoiler warning have rate film fairly low read only see film decide see film david lynch be large part dark satirist most work be do familiar genre way show underside mulholland drive think be have laugh expense crime film genre do film be be sure want read play audience expectation be simple explanation be go first % film tell simple multi - thread crime story clue sprinkle throughout then suddenly end turn story ear large number clue appear add audience expectation be add have give clue be self contradictory lynch want audience argue have see afterward come theory fact pointer be noticeably contradictory hear well explanation think lynch be merely play joke be visual curiosity be popular sixty mad magazine call poiuyt other source call tri - pronged u - bar look small portion make sense look whole figure do film be estimation cinematic equivalent tri - pronged u - bar
106,"bill condon ' s "" gods and monsters "" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics "" frankenstein "" and "" bride of frankenstein . "" since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale ' s inner fantasies and hallucinations . whale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . as the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . james whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , "" a dirty old man . "" in one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale ' s home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . because of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . clayon agrees , and doesn ' t really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . certainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . "" gods and monsters "" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a "" motion picture director , "" rather than a "" horror director . "" and in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . it is evident that whale ' s first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . as played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . he never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . although boone is only in a dead - end job as a gardener of people ' s homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good - looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . since whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . although an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the "" on - again - off - again "" friendship at the film ' s center is fairly predictable . we know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . in lesser hands , this set - up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . also , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . if the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . "" gods and monsters "" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . walking away from "" gods and monsters , "" it was ian mckellen ' s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . it is a sad testament when a person ' s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else ' s business in the first place .",pos,bill condon s god monster be fascinating look last day life gay director jame whale ian mckellan make horror classic frankenstein bride frankenstein be unfamiliar whale prior view film be way know how accurate film be suspect much only come whale inner fantasy hallucination whale fight wwi then go become known work horror picture decide year death age quit filmmake once homosexual scandal break involve film tell end life whale large home l become infatuate tall handsome much young man clayton boone brendan fraser be work gardener home jam whale learn quickly be many people refer film dirty old man opening scene young film enthusiast visit whale home interview whale agree condition question answer young man take article clothing episode know exactly be whale want when ask clayton pose painting later make excuse bright white shirt be disracte only take clayon agree doesn t really think much much warning friend become more more intrigue story whale tell past certainly relationship whale boone be head downfall whale start grow deep love young man even boone be gay whale realize be near conclusion life begin seldom suffer mild stroke moment true catharsis god monster be intimate seemingly respectful portrait director be force become somewhat outcast sexual preference never get recognition have like long be refer motion picture director rather horror director heartbreaking scene attend party boone be guest hold director george cuckor find many other attendee do recognize anymore be evident whale first love life be make movie when career ultimately fall apart so do passion life play brilliantly ian mckellen jame whale come sad dignified man person be afraid stand other just as long know be be true never hide fact be gay however even mean threaten filmmake profession be unblinking honesty make great person complicated relationship develop whale boone boone course only thing whale possible friend talk mean so much more whale see boone sort salvation life boone be only dead end job gardener people s home whale view ideal man only be good look even be attraction first begin feeling one actually listen whale live only loyal disapprove maid touchingly portray lynn redgrave be boone whale talk ultimate reclusion world only reason whale finally decide attend gathering george cuckor extremely fine mature picture few small element hold film back ultimate greatness be appreciate film do pull obvious overly dramatic story development be little thin structuring again again friendship film center be fairly predictable know early where character be head guess be final confrontation tension slowly build less hand set up have feel too calculate be surprisingly deft treatment writing help film be much more also subplot be briefly bring clayton waitress work bar effectively play lolita davidovich abruptly drop never bring again film be go follow side story then perhaps have be take altogether god monster be heartfelt intelligent motion picture impressively direct bill condon sense relate fully understand meaning curious relationship whale boone film also play tribute fine man meet untimely end walk away god monster be ian mckellen marvelous astounding performance leave most impression doubt have be have step role more fully believably be sad testament when person true talent love be unfairly take away base scrutinization judgement personal life ironically enough be one else business first place
107,"if there ' s one thing i just can ' t stand , it ' s a film that oozes with sentimentality . here ' s a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . swelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless . alas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up . what reminded me was that i wasn ' t choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter . my giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un - cute ( i detest the word "" cute "" but i ' ve chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a "" cute "" film here ) . it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience . maybe it will work for some people . it didn ' t work for me . billy crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania . he ' s in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film . the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall . his name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he ' d be a great movie star because of his size . subplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he ' s never around for them , so they move to chicago . max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins . sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved . sam is broke . max is dying . pass the kleenex . my giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny . it has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself . in one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn ' t believe that he ' s actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) . crystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he ' s countered by a slew of jokes that aren ' t funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes . muresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can ' t act very well . quinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents . she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff . here , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent . all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre . as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings . sam ' s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) . later , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam ' s reunion with his family . and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) . it ' s icky . it drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions . my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film . more importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is . instead , it ' s a complicated , overlong , and under - engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears . and since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world .",neg,' thing just ' t stand ' s film ooze sentimentality here s note film maker film be more effective when emotion character speak swell sadden music be good way tell people film be unhappy situation be hopeless giant be film use manipulative sentimentality so frequently such high intensity forget watch be other way get audience member choke remind be wasn t choke even slight bit move matter giant be forced contrive conspicuously un - cute detest word cute ' ve choose use maker clearly want create cute film here take premise have be interesting like preview bog endless plot turn cliche be intend get kind easy emotional rise audience maybe work people didn t work billy crystal play sam cayman agent beginning film be romania ' romania kid actor make famous be do film screenplay have romania get fire get car accident get save enormous individual stand almost foot tall name be max gheorghe muresan sam think be great movie star size subplot be follow sam have son wife kathleen quinlan ' s never around so move chicago max be love woman name lilianna move away romania year film begin sam convince max go back america make lot money so various subplot be resolve sam be break max be die pass kleenex giant comedy be only moderately funny have moment good feature steven seagal make fun great scene sam get son phone talk seagal course son doesn t believe ' actually speak seagal go how bad actor be quote line like probably lose effect crystal be always entertaining have few good line here be subtle throwaway many miss entirely often however ' s counter slew joke aren t funny cause involuntary rolling eye muresan be kind of fun watch just t act very well quinlan other hand be great actress need get role show talent be underuse last year event horizon breakdown least film have moment show stuff here good thing get do be fake romanian accent disappointing ingredient create film much running time be simply mediocre giant lumber inevitable conclusion however director michael lehmann do great job direct underrated hudson hawk scriptwriter david seltzer pile cliche imaginable one intend specifically pull heartstring sam multiple engagement family be all completely hackneyed how main character have healthy relationship family later turn entire story be suppose be great big metaphor signify sam reunion family people think sam do max end be valiant thing have few morality problem apologize be vague ' icky drip gooey wannabe human emotion giant have be straightforward funny family film more importantly have be move level far deep be instead ' s complicated overlong under engage film elicit too few laugh strive superficial tear leave feel completely unmoved stand position sentimentality be evil ultimately destroy world
108,"in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone ' s wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses . wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill - or - be - killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan - era businessman . stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the fast - paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange . critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic . i ' m proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them . i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone ' s output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen . stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works ) . this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions . he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane . it ' s all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like . i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top . these guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges . more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street . the only possible solution i can muster is its release date . and not just the timeliness of the "" greed is good "" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one - joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies . in my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes . maybe stone ' s after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace . boiler room is an equally well - timed film with some similarities to stone ' s piece of crap . they both feature a consequential father - son relationship , though boiler room ' s is much more subtle and touching . and they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery - smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street . boiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn ' t shove it in our faces . boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash . as i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn ' t been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! in our super - judgmental , power - oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it "" all "" . and seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it "" all "" the easy way . he ' s a well - intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him . ben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko . his job is to influence trainee ' s into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood . it ' s ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they ' re told to dish out to prospective buyers . affleck ' s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin ' s similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor ' s performance . affleck shouts , curses and be - littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge . when alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own . by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading . the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game . rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters . they aren ' t above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes . we drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be . as in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness . i know this story . we all do . but it can work if it ' s told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \ director ben younger tells it . as a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise - en - scene younger has much to learn . his style is sitcom bland . but his writing isn ' t . younger ' s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet . despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone - pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script . the brokers \ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock . these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn ' t aware that he is one . with the exception of affleck ' s brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional . ribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth . he conveys child - like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren ' t going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he ' s ferociously cut throat . the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it ' s just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) . boiler room thankfully avoids wall street - like histrionics in the sales - pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys . those ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth ' s friend and his mentor . diesl shines in his minor role . this week i saw the sci - fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner . in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80 ' s , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70 ' s . nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can ' t have . nia long , as the firm ' s secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi ' s love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting . the two make an oddly likeable couple . long is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof . at one point he says to her "" i ' m just lookin ' for some chocolate love "" . it ' s a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child - like way , it becomes sweetly endearing . unfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy . there is much crying , hugging , and sorrowful stares . this is okay when taken in small doses , but younger ' s conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo - hoo moments , one following the other . a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth ' s manipulations have on one of his poor victims . it ' s not a bad idea but the execution is lacking , with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message . that message being , "" greed is bad "" . yes it ' s patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven ' t seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur . and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners . boiler room offers neither extreme . it gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful .",pos,stock market crash oliver stone wall street be release critical acclaim pack movie house wall street lucke timing recent crash give film resonation have kill be kill approach business be exaggerated very ideology be key mind set quintessential reagan era businessman stone construct film mythical good evil tale relay fast pace milieu burgeon stock exchange critic audience laud wall street elevate status contemporary classic ' m proud say never be count find wall street be just as axiomatic pander majority stone output thin caricature obvious sentiment charisma barren performance young charlie sheen stone go break scene same be say nearly work approach tend bury purport message heap good intention direct stock exchange scene typical hyperbolic mode people shout phone be plummet airplane ' s excuse stone ratchet emotion false intensity rather explore situation be really have feeling broker be psychologically manipulative be present boiler room rather laughably top guy be salesman after all televise judge more be baffle why so many adore wall street only possible solution muster be release date just timeliness greed be good subject matter film be plump eighty decade joke comedy rise art form group glamorous brat packer smirk way inane high concept low result movie mind eighty forever be remember decade only proliferation bad movie bad music bad hair bad clothe maybe stone s school special set wall street be view welcome change pace boiler room be equally well time film similarity stone s piece crap feature consequential father son relationship boiler room be much more subtle touching be concerned power greed man boiler room be akin poseur presume be big shot rather slippery smooth heartless gordon gecko figure wall street boiler room be message movie as well though least end doesn t shove face boiler room be pursuit cash degree people go cash say film be indeed timely society where want be millionaire be number prime time show day bring revolution prime time tv watch hasn t be see while only do want be millionaire want watch other people become millionaire super -

"" end of days "" is a major stinker . the movie opens in vatican city , 1979 . some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation . if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed . the pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed . in new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy . twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex - cop with a drinking problem . now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil . an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney ) . recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her . there are so many problems with this film it ' s hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . schwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea . arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . in other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they ' ve all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger . there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho ' s character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine ' s location by offering him his old life back . none of these scenes really work , because arnie isn ' t up to the task . the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . this one isn ' t at all believable the way arnold plays him . the supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . as the prince of darkness , he ' s suave and confident . he acts like one would expect the devil to act . the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . byrne out - performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . byrne ' s speech about the bible being "" overrated "" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold ' s attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the "" ' tis not ! "" variety ) are feeble at best . the only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . kevin pollack plays jericho ' s security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . robin tunney isn ' t given much to do except look scared . in fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do . performances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it . this being an action blockbuster , it ' s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it ' s utterly ridiculous . why is the devil coming on new year ' s eve , 1999 ? because it ' s exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn ' t 666 , it turns out . some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you ' ve got 1999 ! if you don ' t buy this explanation , you ' re not alone . it ' s convoluted and silly at the same time . the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she ' s christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . . . ) , and if that weren ' t bad enough , there ' s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn ' t explained at all . why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex - cop , he ' s powerless ? is he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? how come he can ' t control jericho or christine ? and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it ' s never actually explained . usually , this sort of thing wouldn ' t matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don ' t get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting . there are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in "" end of days , "" complete with the old "" black cat hiding in a cabinet "" bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there . it gets so formulaic that it ' s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a "" boo "" will come . their predictions will rarely be wrong . the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don ' t care about these characters ( due to the script ' s pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don ' t make any sense . there ' s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady . it ' s good for a few chuckles , but not much else . supposedly we ' re to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly . none of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it ' s often hard to tell why it ' s happening in the first place , not to mention that they ' re edited in full - on incomprehensible mtv quick - cut style . most of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , "" wow , cool ! "" "" end of days "" is not only silly and confusing , but it ' s also distinctly unpleasant to watch . the devil apparently doesn ' t operate in the more subtle , i ' ll - convince - people - to - kill - each - other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight . this doesn ' t only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in "" end of days "" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head ) . if violence is supposed to be shocking , it ' s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb . scenes aren ' t connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why . reasons ? to hell with reasons ! let ' s just blow stuff up ! isn ' t it cool ? nope , not by a long shot . this film is thoroughly unwatchable . it ' s dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity . perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it ' s not happening with hack peter hyams here . "" end of days "" might have had camp value , if only it didn ' t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody ' s going to buy . if the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script . if it ' s going to be campy , arnold shouldn ' t be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn ' t actually see him put up on a cross , did i ? ) , and his character shouldn ' t be such a sad sack . as it stands , "" end of days "" is just a bad movie , and an awfully gloomy one at that .",neg,think stigmata be bad religiously orient thriller release year turn be wrong stigmata be merely boring self important end day be completely inept front ' s silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess guy grow watch arnold schwarzenegger good ' extremely disconcerting see where big man have end first time recent memory arnold action movie batman robin doesn t count be fun at all end day be major stinker movie open vatican city catholic priest have observe ancient prophecy say girl be bear night satan have target impregnation impregnate midnight december world be destroy pope order protection girl priest believe be kill new york very night girl be bear fulfill prophecy year later meet jericho cane schwarzenegger suicidal ex -

113,"when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . i ' m happy to say that there ' s something about mary is not one of those trailer let - downs . in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can ' t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . earl brown ) , who ' s being harassed by one of the school jocks . it seems warren ' s sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted ' s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . ted was just flattered that she even knew his name . unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn ' t seen since that fateful day . with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . there ' s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co - workers to think you had such a great time watching them . with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you ' ll not only enjoy , but also won ' t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers ' last two films ) they almost all work . i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . one minute you ' ll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you ' ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary ' s apartment . one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he ' s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . ted ' s a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don ' t always work out . it ' s comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . actually , i ' ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid - eighties . the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise / paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big - time bowling hustler . it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short - lived "" the ben stiller show "" on the fox network in late ' 92 / early ' 93 . like "" the critic "" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show ' s cancellation . cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper - thin at times . however , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she ' s got guys just falling over each other to be with her . heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn ' t change , and you know , it ' s really true . he and ralph macchio must hang out or something . maybe they live in dick clark ' s pool house . anyway , here ' s another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary ' s heart . the supporting performances are also good . chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . lin shae , who plays mary ' s neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji - like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . lee evans , as mary ' s friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren ' t any noticeable times where the film drags . the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot - relevant information right toward the camera . it ' s a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . after that it got a little annoying , and it ' s unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow . fortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there ' s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater .",pos,when see trailer film laugh hard have time be therefore pretty well psyched see be ever mindful trailer make even most mediocre film look good ' m happy say mary be trailer let down fact watch film be fine way spend hour film open flashback high school cumberland rhode island te stroehmann ben stiller be social reject ' t seem get date upcoming prom come defense mentally retarded warren w earl brown ' s be harass school jock seem warren sister be campus queen mary jensen cameron diaz be impressed te willingness stand defenseless brother very real chance get beat mary take immediate liking te ask prom te be just flatter even know name unfortunately prom night be ruin when te have accident zipper man theater wince be send hospital fast forward present where te have clean now write magazine have weekly therapy session order deal obsession past year mary hasn t see fateful day help friend dom chris elliott te hire slimy private investigator pat healy matt dillon track only love however when pat find mary fall too soon be compete affection ' mary be direct bobby peter farrelly bring dumb dumb kingpin exactly intelligent comedy be guilty pleasure variety where want friend co -

114,"( note : there are spoilers regarding the film ' s climax ; the election , of course ) we see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he ' s been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they ' ve demeaned his masculinity , his self - respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world . and yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) . no matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she ' s the real threat . about to give in , and divulge that she ' s won by only a lone vote , broderick ' s mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy ' s euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , ' no ' . the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry . she can ' t go higher than him . he won ' t allow it . and what ' s amazing about "" election "" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor . early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher . it ' s like payne and taylor , his co - screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers ' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist . and it ' s amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it ' s happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around "" nice "" persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters . it ' s with mandy barnett ' s "" if you ' ll be the teacher "" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony . sexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne ' s satire , or its success . it also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries . satire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not . it ' s a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( "" drop dead gorgeous "" leaps infuriatingly to mind ) . payne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart . we sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about . minus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen "" ferris bueller ' s day off "" . whatever .",pos,note be spoiler regard film climax election course see matthew broderick man tear primal state ' s be unfaithful wife lie manipulate student same token ' ve demean masculinity self respect desperate attempt change world yet equate cause pain torment tracy flick reese witherspoon no matter how many student have come go disappoint educator ' s real threat about give divulge ' s win only lone vote broderick mccalister turn defeat see tracy euphoric celebration outside corridor say fact simultaneously lust ideologically far illustrate freudian foundation entitlement man no matter how obscure have relationship traditional expectation success usurp surpass woman proverbial industry ' t go high win t allow s amazing election be word criticism be draw rather opaque metaphor early film learn tracy be romantically then sexually involve now depart teacher ' s payne taylor co - screenwriter have take tracy girl desperate friendship loyalty almost perversely draw mythological pattern kid be so utterly reject peer find sit teacher lunch table more fitting unlikely extreme protagonist ' s amazing compassion have seem so real merely ' happen before splash all front page all nice persona people easily dismiss truly wayward deed character ' s mandy barnett s ' be teacher play winsomely closing credit payne skewer tenet detractor most final viscous injection bittersweet irony sexuality though be only basis payne s satire success also make telling point politic friendship class boundary satire be require be anyway take seriously act so audience do ' s fine line straddle film ignore altogether drop dead gorgeous leap infuriatingly mind payne taylor hit right chord character be real people be perfect rather lead be flawed misguided individual retain somewhat noble intention heart sympathize still satire idiosyncratic behavior wrongdoing be take extreme audience knowingly chuckle also reflect meditate about point though payne admit have see ferris bueller day off

116,"a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets . the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities . the result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn ' t build on to show them as the poets they were . on paper , this shouldn ' t have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( "" the secret garden "" ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast . but the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud . i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade . he , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be . but when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch . leonardo ' s rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude , yet we know from rimbaud ' s poetry , that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring . the film opens in post - revolutionary france in 1871 , the 16 - year - old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems . he accepts verlaine ' s praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home , and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville . once there , rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household , has an immediate conflict with verlaine ' s busty 18 - year - old wife mathilde ( romane ) , and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family ' s money , even though he has nothing else in common with her . when verlaine states , "" poets can learn from one another , "" rimbaud replies in a haughty tone , "" only if they ' re bad poets . "" he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship . verlaine proves to be weak - willed , beating his wife regularly , and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud . when mathilde ' s father kicks rimbaud out of the house , verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers . it ' s a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets , which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce . in brussels , verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail . while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 . he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun - runner , and after ten years there , comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 . the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying . the film ends on a whimper . . . with verlaine talking with rimbaud ' s sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses , which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published . this film was especially annoying because rimbaud ' s poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry . i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn ' t work . it certainly didn ' t bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so - called father of modern poetry .",neg,disappointing biography homosexual relationship famous 19th century french poet film manage remove poetry poet instead concentrate abrasive personality result be merely academic exercise leave emotional vacuum couldn t build show poet be paper shouldn t have be so terrible have talented director agnieszka holland secret garden prove screenwriter christopher hampton dangerous liaison capable cast film be do inept script unappealing way film be direct miscasting leonardo dicaprio rimbaud find performance be most risible one film act more teenage brat young genius spouting obsenitie give hint true poet lie facade especially look bad david thewli paul verlaine look so good turgid dialogue be thrust how thin character be force be when be together look mismatch leonardo rimbaud only make young poet look petulant crude know rimbaud poetry have have go poetry be awe inspiring film open post - revolutionary france year old rimbaud have send establish symbolist poet verlaine letter poem accept verlaine praise invitation be house guest splendid paris home rimbaud leave sullen farm rural charleville once there rimbaud be disappoint bourgeoisie household have immediate conflict verlaine busty year old wife mathilde romane find regret drunken verlaine love rich wife body live family money even have else common when verlaine state poet learn rimbaud reply haughty tone only ' re bad poet continue treat old poet dirt rest relationship verlaine prove be weak willed beat wife regularly play just as despicable character rimbaud when mathilde father kick rimbaud house verlaine find room house become lover ' s real downer watch story unfold series obnoxious behavior pattern part poet lead travel together mathilde ask divorce brussel verlaine get arrest sodomy spend year jail rimbaud become angered literary world never write poem become instead go north africa become adventurer gun runner year there come home tumor knee die change man age hopeless relationship be picture cover detail be very satisfying film end whimper verlaine talk rimbaud sister brother poem still possess sister want destroy so embarrass family ruin name deceased brother publish film be especially annoying rimbaud s poem be fill visionary tenseness be even approach film film only manage skim surface life poet completely ignore value poetry have idea filmmaker be try say film be just didn t work certainly didn t bring light understand rimbaud mean modern poetry why earn reputation so call father modern poetry

119,"you ' ve seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing . the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor ' s nell in the haunting , we don ' t care . the hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike . the seasons have changed since an ex - patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom . desperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) . the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm ' s would - be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret . only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine - tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time . malcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole ' s anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures . he will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process . the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist . ( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self - rearranging kitchen business from the latter . ) it ' s far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks . cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they ' re not out to harm him , really - they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler . perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we ' re looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight - year - old . that ' s right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar . we appreciate malcolm ' s domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed . both actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest . willis convinces us that he ' s a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night . osment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do . the sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs ' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama - its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading . only because i was expecting something different did i notice - rather , feel - the movie ' s running time , which is just shy of two hours . the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait . i ' m not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity .",pos,' ve see moment before recently particularly troubled character sense danger paranormal kind when room temperature inexplicably plummet freezing difference be when happen lili taylor nell haunting don t care hero sixth sense young boy name cole be rich creation wish more ghost haunt take hike season have change ex - patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe willi comfort own bedroom desperate get career back track even expense crumble marriage williams rushmore malcolm council deeply troubled cole osment preteen display quirk malcolm be killer scar body antisocial behaviour reluctance reveal big secret only cole be lock closet bully hospitalize result do divulge malcolm spine tingle scene see dead people walk time malcolm assume give profession reasonably so cole be schizophrenic psychic sincerity cole anguished confession prevent doctor take drastic measure instead pursue supernatural angle become kind surrogate father cole live single mother lynn collette process sixth sense have more common ghost poltergeist shyamalan do somewhat unforgiveably crib self rearrange kitchen business latter ' s far more heartwarming frightening film be none bad wear few pulp shock cole attract dead reason unknown ' re harm really just want be hear even mean scare bejesus innocent gradeschooler perhaps apparition seem more ghastly first really be ' look situation eye year old right willi first time year give spotlight costar appreciate malcolm domestic dilemma identify cole recall fear bogeyman closet monster thing bed actor deliver immensely likable performance dynamic be manifest willis convince ' s doctor be unable do horndog shrink overheated color night osment be phenomenal true professional resist mug camera child star too much experience television commercial do sixth sense atmospherically shoot silence lamb cinematographer tak fujimoto be actually drama spooky effective ad campaign be misleading only be expect different do notice rather feel movie run time be just shy hour story unfurl slowly engrossingly unexpected finish be definitely worth wait ' m sure say big twist ending be bulletproof admire audacity

121,""" he ' s back , and it ' s about time .

"" but he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , "" i always . . . dress . . . for the occasion . "" you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who ' s also british , like mcgann is as the doctor . executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role . i dunno who thought of casting him , but if they ' re reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star ! he rides on his sister ' s coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him . is this problem the kisses to the past ? they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they ' re good . is it the script or the movie as a whole ? the script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series . so what is it ? simple : no plot . the master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him . the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee ' s help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn ' t close it by then . virtually no plot . i was told the movie would ' ve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set . that shows how smart people are , as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting , and that would ' ve gotten a four star rating out of me .",pos,' s back ' s time be motto television series pilot call pilot don t care fox network say revival cult classic british tv show doctor spawn series mean be smart network exec out there exactly news lot people know motto be well choose series be simple be about time lord scientist call doctor life travel around type spaceship call tardis outsmart kind alien baddie include evil dalek master appear feature play very badly eric robert as good revival be be miss make sure be really doctor be acting paul mcgann be just as good other guy ' ve play doctor include predecessor screen friend sylvester mccoy appear once more regeneration scene look right role be brilliant actor slip effortlessly role way favorite jon pertwee tom baker daphne ashbrook bring class role dr grace holloway doctor first companion kiss screen be typical female companion scream spend free time make coffee doctor be tough spunky american ashbrook show well young yee jee tso show promise chang lee ' ve see other stuff usually play punk kid die end film include imho waste talent only problem acting be eric robert time have say mcgann s doctor always dress occasion break say so slowly wound sound song lyric always dress occasion need actor less slow less reliant move hand act ' s also british mcgann be doctor executive producer phil segal say be cast fox insist have american star role dunno think cast ' read news flash eric robert be star ride sister s coattail hit movie make have do be problem kiss past have reference show so subtle non fan notice only whovian ' re good be script movie whole script be classy piece work feature master spit slime mouth nice dialogue movie whole be fan love be good stand alone view nonfan enjoy series so be simple plot master last leg send doctor rescue dalek put trial planet skaro exterminate doctor attempt take remain back gallifrey accidentally land san francisco december where master young street hood chang lee help open eye harmony suck earth midnight doctor help female surgeon dr grace holloway doesn t close then virtually plot be tell movie ' ve feature dalek screen start more courtroom drama master dalek lot rewrite go set show how smart people be have make movie hell lot more interesting ' ve get star rating

should this guy be forced to do something he doesn ' t want to do ? this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam - packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should . i ' m not saying "" good will hunting "" is a bad film at all . it ' s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it . the acting is amazing , with two oscar - nomination - worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together . we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will ' s love interest , skylar . there are tons of individual moments that i adored . i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them . i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends . there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch . and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable . like the break - up scene between will and skylar , will and sean ' s first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn ' t regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter . however , the main flaw of the film is there ' s too much of everything , and not enough of it either . the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they ' re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten . take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father / son as well as doctor / patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face . we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times . but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do . also , will ' s relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action . we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one . their relationship never goes beyond "" just best friends , "" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human . maybe it was just me . and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten . and , of course , as in most films like this , the girl / boy relationship is pretty underwritten . we never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it ' s there for plot details that anything else . minnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character . the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness . sure , it feels overstuffed , but it ' s extremely enjoyable . the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human . i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing . while this is probably director gus van sant ' s most conservative film ( you ' d hardly know it ' s the same director of "" to die for , "" the only van sant film i ' ve seen , really ) , it ' s still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what ' s this "" best picture "" deal ?

123,"the ads make "" hanging up "" seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father and his three daughters . anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed . all of the movie ' s funny scenes were included in the ad . so what do we get ? eve marks ( meg ryan ) just put her father lou mozell ( walter matthau ) into a hospital . once upon a time , lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now - estranged wife . his one great moment in life was writing a film for john wayne , who gave him a giant bullet - shaped trophy . now lou is senile and deteriorating rapidly . eve tries to convince her sisters georgia ( diane keaton ) and maddy ( lisa kudrow ) that their father is dying and needs them . both are slow to show concern . so devoted eve stands vigil over her father , who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia , while running her own business ( planning special events ) and caring for her son ( jesse james ) . ( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st . bernard for eve to care for . ) the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve ' s events where georgia is the keynote speaker . there ' s a superficial resemblance to shakespeare ' s "" king lear "" ( senile king with three daughters : one devoted saint and two selfish bitches ) , but the material is apparently drawn from life . sister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team . henry and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays , including "" desk set "" and "" there ' s no business like show business . "" ( delia ' s novel , the basis for the film , is dedicated to henry ) . surprisingly , the script is as thin as an anorexic ' s wet dream . the virtue of a semi - autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available . yet , the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters . also , the spaces they inhabit seem artificial . eve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout ; no matter how put - upon she is , we can ' t feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day . georgia is a famous magazine editor , and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile . when we first meet maddy , she ' s fishing at a picturesque mountain stream . i expected to see the credit "" cinematography by ' vanity fair . ' "" and , yes , diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow ' s mother . to her credit , though , she looks young enough to pull it off . the one redeeming aspect of "" hanging up "" is that , at its core , is a truth about siblings . there ' s always one on which everyone else in the family relies , freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant . my wife is the reliable child in her family ; for better or worse , my brother has the role in mine . ( being selfish and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling , but it is a lot less work ) . if you have nothing better to do than watch this movie , look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters ' mother pat . in a devastating scene , eve discovers that her mother doesn ' t love her . although leachman is best known for comedies like "" young frankenstein "" and "" the mary tyler moore show , "" her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in "" the last picture show .

124,"when i first saw the previews for ron howard ' s latest film , my expectations were discouragingly low . a show about nothing ? sounds like "" seinfeld .

125,"here ' s something to chew on : what ' s the favorite food of big , cheesy - looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? the obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that ' s the depth of the most fully - developed character in this painfully generic creature feature . deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer . in fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was . the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore . not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non - human ) been scattered in all directions . we learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half - digested leftovers . i suppose deep rising ' s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn ' t do much for me . on the surface , and that ' s about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens / titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) . in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue - in - cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin . the film is not humorous , tense , or exciting . in fact , it ' s downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron ' s current box - office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie . is it really necessary to say anything about the plot ? probably not , since it ' s easy to guess , but i ' ll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis . the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship . in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there ' s finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat ' s pilot , who ' s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o ' connor ) , the inept sidekick who ' s supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the "" mastermind "" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation . their goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally - acquired torpedoes . the problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic - like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste . aside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there ' s no one on board . the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles . the cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has - beens and probably - never - will - bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad ' s cinque ) . williams , once a "" can ' t miss "" prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career . famke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams . given her limited acting abilities , it ' s likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes . unfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee - shirt for half of the picture . meanwhile , kevin j . o ' connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard . these days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer - generated special effects . this is a lesson that writer / director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live - action jungle book ) needs to learn . the days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past . now , movie - goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well - incorporated that it ' s impossible to tell where they end and where "" reality "" begins . in deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing . unfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn ' t so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) . even once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won ' t be the last of its kind . like the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush . and that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying .",neg,here s chew s favorite food big cheesy look special effect monster one lurk bowel luxury liner deep rise obvious answer question be cardboard s depth most fully develop character painfully generic creature feature deep rise demonstrate originality vitality script computer fact consider rigid adherence expected formula perhaps be most astonishing thing deep rise be exceptionally high level gore starship trooper have many chunk flesh human non -

127,"when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be "" you too can believe whales can fly "" . then it was going to be "" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly "" . then , it was going to be "" you too can believe wood sprites can fly "" . finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . there ' s a lot of flying going on in this film ! as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $ 110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . subsequent re - releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . is the format effective for the film ? with a few exceptions , yes . the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven ' s fifth symphony . it ' s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat - like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat - like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . though this segment isn ' t very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . the next segment is set to ottorino respighi ' s "" the pines of rome "" . in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the "" oceans "" of clouds . again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . the cgi whales look incredibly life - like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . absolutely beautiful stuff . the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin ' s "" rhapsody in blue "" . this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . there ' s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out - of - work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . i won ' t go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich ' s "" piano concerto no . 2 "" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen ' s "" the steadfast tin soldier "" . a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind - up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can ' t see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack - in - the - box jester . the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . little does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . although the ending has been altered from the andersen story , "" the steadfast tin soldier "" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . some children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . segment five is the funniest of the bunch . set to camille saint - saens "" the carnival of the animals "" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo - yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it ' s the one that people remember most , "" the sorcerer ' s apprentice "" . the story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . unfortunately , the segment wasn ' t made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18 - plus screen theaters . segment seven is set to sir edward elgar ' s "" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 "" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character . donald duck "" stars "" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark . during the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn ' t make it on the boat . they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners . despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear - jerkers foisted on audiences these days . powerful stuff . segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? "" saving the best for last "" . set to igor stravinsky ' s "" the firebird "" , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape . trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation . when the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird . in a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create . some amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) . the host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin ' s clip is pretty funny . be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin . penn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting . the best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board . pieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner ' s "" ride of the valkyries "" , and a strange segment prepared in the ' 40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments . for fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material . as i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters . i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . then you too can believe that whales / triangle things / sprites can fly .

130,"pitch black is a sheep in wolf ' s clothing . it is full of darkness , danger and violence and if you buy into the marketing hype , an unsettling and scary film going experience . don ' t be fooled . pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare - fest . it starts off with blistering intensity . a cargo spaceship crash lands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns . among the survivors is fry ( mitchell ) , the ship ' s pilot , who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely . there is imam ( david ) , an islamic leader whose faith in his god is tested repeatedly throughout the film . there is a law enforcement officer in the form of johns ( hauser ) , who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal . and there is riddick ( diesel ) , a menacing , muscle - bound convicted murderer who ' s being brought back to justice by johns . the group quickly sizes up the situation and each other . confident in their assessment of matters , a plan is set in motion to escape their hellish environment . those plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planet ' s wildlife , a predatory , sometimes winged , species that enjoys the taste of blood and flesh . fortunately , the creatures are light sensitive and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planet ' s surface . unfortunately , the group has managed to land on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur , taking away their one protection from the monsters . the group ' s savior comes in the form of johns , whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory . or does it ? pitch black deviates from the standard sci - fi fare by avoiding some of the stock "" escape the boogieman "" conflicts the genre typically serves up . just as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness , first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false . the excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures , but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth . a recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith , whether it be religious or in a person , and how that powers their motivations . i found it telling that an accidental death occurs early on due to the misperception of a self professed atheist . conversely , imam constantly contributes any good fortune to allah . one by one , his perceived heaven sent blessings are taken away and crushed . imam is forced to reassess his faith . another character expresses belief in god , along with a life long hate . yet another character makes a decision that echoes the sentiments of christ about selflessness and has lasting repercussions for several of group . it is a fascinating character study hiding under the guise of a scare flick . special mention should be made of vin diesel , who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with a truly mesmerizing presence . his character could have easily slipped into a parody of the baddass killing machine , but twohy and diesel add surprising depth to riddick . they can be excused for the two or three shwarzenegger - like catch phrases that growl their way out of diesel ' s mouth . the movie has its flaws that can be nitpicked . the creatures do look derivative of the ones in alien . the dialogue isn ' t the freshest at times , reminiscent of a bad comic book . yes , the appearance of riddick ' s vision skills are more than a little timely considering the situation . these trappings are on the periphery of the story twohy is really trying to tell . twohy may have lured you in under the pretense of scaring you with film fabricated boogieman , but he shows the real boogieman to be the prejudices and beliefs we use to direct decisions in our lives .",pos,pitch black be sheep wolf clothing be full darkness danger violence buy marketing hype unsettling scary film go experience don t be fool pitch black be morality play masquerade scare f start blister intensity cargo spaceship crash land planet apparently leech life scorch heat sun survivor be fry mitchell ship s pilot spend film wrestling fact try jettison other passenger effort land craft safely be imam david islamic leader faith god be test repeatedly film be law enforcement officer form johns hauser attack situation square jaw authoritarian zeal be riddick diesel menacing muscle bind convict murderer ' s be bring back justice johns group quickly size situation other confident assessment matter plan be set motion escape hellish environment plan be shred appearance planet wildlife predatory sometimes wing specie enjoy taste blood flesh fortunately creature be light sensitive be force live network catacomb planet surface unfortunately group have manage land planet moment eclipse be about occur take protection monster group savior come form johns decisive leadership look deliver purgatory do pitch black deviate standard sci fi fare avoid stock escape boogieman conflict genre typically serve just planet give false facade lifelessness first appearance give survivor prove be just as false excitement film come danger pose creature rather watch shift allegiance emotional growth character planet serve deus ex machina sort catalyze emotional growth recurrent theme run movie faith be religious person how power motivation find tell accidental death occur early on misperception self profess atheist conversely imam constantly contribute good fortune allah perceive heaven send blessing be take away crush imam be force reassess faith character express belief god life long hate character make decision echo sentiment christ selflessness have last repercussion several group be fascinating character study hide guise scare flick special mention be make vin diesel intriguingly convey feral menace combine truly mesmerizing presence character have easily slip parody baddass kill machine twohy diesel add surprising depth riddick be excuse shwarzenegger like catch phrase growl way diesel mouth movie have flaw be nitpick creature do look derivative one alien dialogue t the fresh time reminiscent bad comic book appearance riddick vision skill be more little timely consider situation trapping be periphery story twohy be really try tell twohy have lure pretense scare film fabricate boogieman show real boogieman be prejudice belief use direct decision life
131,"well there goes another one . sadly this like other movies this year wasn ' t good . this one being almost as bad as ' the omega code ' but not quite . from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right . with bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight - out bad direction ' the bachelor ' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn ' t work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance . the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best . the movie is troubled from the start because chris o ' donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date . here is the stupid plot : chris o ' donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years . jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up . he really doesn ' t realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch ) . so he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad . he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any . then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars . . . . as long as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm . now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un - funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths . ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs . even the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren ' t even good . the plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old . the choppy dialogue and bad directing don ' t help things any . even though chris o ' donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him . rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming , sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout . her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen . brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big - headed mogul who after a while became routine and old . one really can ' t help but think that we have seen this stuff before . it ' s not like this is an original idea and in the end , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness . ' the bachelor ' works on no good levels and in fact doesn ' t work at all . ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career . chris o ' donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal . he seems held back and really doesn ' t get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old . artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un - nerving . why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie , with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know . maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success , and sometimes i don ' t agree with other critics on movies , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts . its based on the 1925 silent film ' seven chances ' which i am sure is very better than this mess . even though some may think of this as a good date movie , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back . besides being a terrible movie , ' the bachelor ' is well a terrible movie . it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can ' t recommend this movie . i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times . the running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes . parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time . being one of the worst movies of the year , we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies , and if they do they i give up on filmmakers .",neg,go one sadly other movie year wasn t good one be almost as bad omega code quite opening credit have good feeling be bad guess be right bad excuse acting horrible screenplay straight out bad direction bachelor be terribly unfunny movie doesn t work level accept fact rene zellwegar do give good performance cameo brooke shield carey be also good brooke be good movie be trouble start chris o donnell be hugely miscast give bad performance date here be stupid plot chris o donnell play jimmie shelton man have just break girlfriend meet anne rene zellwegar instantly hit be together year jimmie decide want bring relationship little bit really doesn t realize anne think want marry want never do catch so propose really bad way shoot be very mad course try apologize seem help then grandfather die learn have leave jimmie dollar as long marry next day pm now jimmie find anne try marry get money love get married else get money lead un funny predictable ending leave bad taste mouth so maybe be dumb cliched silliest romantic comedy date have real big laugh even support role artie lange hal holbrook ed anser aren t even good plot be good idea script have have be write less minute year old choppy dialogue bad direct don t help thing even chris o donnell give ok performance batman movie do give even remotely good funny performance here want boo throw pop screen get rid rene zelweggar be different story give charming sweet likable performance usual really be only thing save confused movie be total huge washout sister play marley shelton be also good have good chemistry onscreen brooke shield show funny little performance big headed mogul while become routine old really t help think have see stuff before ' s be original idea end know be go happen due do cliche typicalness bachelor work good level fact doesn t work at all ed anser hal holbrook be waste terrible role carey act save soul be only film movie career dispite terrific music career chris o donnell be as bad actor casper van dien be say great deal seem hold back really doesn t get character much even first minute get annoying old artie lange just seem be try chris farley be completely unfunny un - nerving why filmmaker want waste cast bad movie such bad acting dialogue be question only know maybe think become hit critical success sometimes don t agree other critic movie even trailer film make look bad show mildly funny part base silent film chance be sure be very well mess even think good date movie most see want pull thi hair scream thi money back be terrible movie bachelor be well terrible movie have worth recommend therefore really ' t recommend movie do have good time laugh only time run time movie be minute be wayyyy time need be shorten least minute part seem go forever part seem last enough time be bad movie year be sure hope make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedy do give filmmaker

133,"since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller "" blood simple , "" joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood . their films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances . in "" the big lebowski , "" their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award - winning "" fargo , "" the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude . the dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood ' s most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high . the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties . he has shaggy , shoulder - length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee - shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks . he smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in . one day , the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski ( david huddleston ) , this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife , bunny ( tara reid ) , owes a lot of people a lot of money . the main plot and all its accompanying side - plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here . suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money . by the time all is said and done , walter has become deeply involved , as has the big lebowski ' s daughter , maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist performance artist , a pornographer named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) , and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare , who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in "" fargo . "" "" the big lebowski "" plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers ' earlier efforts . it shares their previous films ' strong sense of time and place , as well as their send - ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies .

134,"for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and "" high art , "" the son ' s room is an inventive , subtle alternative . written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement . slow is the best description for the film at first . it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family . father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities . they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder . you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome . but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident . the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span . though the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving . though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn ' t come across as a vanity piece . one might wish he hadn ' t picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character ' s reactions so predictable . what saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction . the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss . you start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing . you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation . even better are the role reversals that take place within the household . while giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot . not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she ' ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them . these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change . respectfully , gender issues never enter the picture . self - propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family . though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives . most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing . in contrast , the son ' s room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters . it ' s not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to .",pos,associate italian cinema fellini high art son s room be inventive subtle alternative write direct star nanni moretti take slow complicated path bereavement slow be good description film first take time establish habit appear be normal happy family father mother work still find time support son daughter homework school activity laugh spend free time together reprimand kid innocent wrong sigh soft pat shoulder get feeling be open communication unconditional love foursome suddenly son be find be dead diving accident family dynamic begin unpredictable descent give narrative strength when least expect also be try attention span film drag even repeat be somewhat excuse influence process grieving nanni moretti wear several hat production doesn t come vanity piece wish hadn t pick profession analyst father giovanni star only make character s reaction so predictable save be well write script spare dialogue eclectic variety human interaction potency film lie recreation tiny detail everyday life alter death close relative remind depressed person loss start take notice crack dish ignore when familial bliss be full swing remember bond routine jog block necessarily huge event graduation even well be role reversal take place household giovanni paola laura morante do check daughter irene jasmine trinca be sense be autopilot only do irene begin take care own need more ' make parent breakfast attempt crack new shell life scene provide interesting portrayal various cope mechanism frequently cross boundary how much help other drastic unexpected change respectfully gender issue never enter picture self propel isolation be universal term dealing so moretti intelligently use tool separate family giovanni do stop paolo discuss andrea party friend be never sense be more stoic more correct search restore sense balance life most film broach topic death utilize annoying melodrama speech conciliatory issue get waterworks flow contrast son room capture more realistic depiction effect death family graciously flow stage mourning denial depression anger bargaining acceptance main character ' s most engaging minute be certainly easy relate

"" with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life . lester works for an advertising agency . his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid - life crisis he is suffering . estranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress . his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy . carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman / homemaker . she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings . but inside she is desperate . unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family . the third member of this anti - family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn ' s daughter . a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction . this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple . not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her . some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters . most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts . she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one . colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man . his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham ' s . in fact they are the next door neighbors . anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in "" american beauty "" . alan ball , who was the co - executive producer of the hit tv series "" cybil "" and creator of the new sitcom "" oh grow up "" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years . not one character in this film rings falsely . and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful . the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as "" the graduate "" or "" lolita "" . kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances . his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age . finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth . he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year ' s salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter ' s girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet . mr . spacey ' s performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees . annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career . carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy . unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder . ms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone . the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words . thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her . jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment . her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning . she is the prototypical trophy child . when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( "" i ' m so proud of you , honey . you didn ' t screw up once ! "" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable . thora birch is a young actress to watch . praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance . colonel finn is a man in complete denial . his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend . wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma . the boy next door who may be more foe than friend . a deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him . mr . bentley ' s performance is the one troublesome note in the film . that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it . director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle . scenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character . the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it ' s harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) . every nuance of "" american beauty "" begs it ' s audience to think and examine . it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come . and well it should , as it is simply one of this years best .",pos,dreamwork picture present jink cohen company production kevin spacey annette bene american beauty thora birch allison janney peter gallagher mena suvari wes bentley chris cooper co -

136,"out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller . though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it ' s not nearly good enough . in an aggressively non - linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex - con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery . he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny . he doesn ' t know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine . valentine was jenny ' s former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive . he ' s played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee ' s gold in 1997 . seeking valentine ' s reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party . he winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine ' s head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it . what a mess . i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . the limey does exactly that . the plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash - forwards and what can only be described as random time - travel , without any evident purpose . there is no method to this movie ' s madness . it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably . the plot isn ' t particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving . this is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn ' t speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . i felt like the director wasn ' t very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck . ditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant . sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal . he ' s not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here . peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he ' s shy , quiet but always effective . he ' s adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don ' t always show on his face by you can always tell what they are . this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion . why soderbergh couldn ' t just parrot down and tell a story , i don ' t know , but what he does do certainly doesn ' t work . the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don ' t work . 1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it . shall we go back to basics ?",neg,sight director steven sorderbergh baffle hell limey cold uninvolving confuse new thriller plot description first seem come pen elmore leonard author sight as well jackie brown get shorty pulp fiction watch realize ' s nearly good enough aggressively non -

137,"it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable . the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed . it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner . what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 . what drags braveheart down is its screenplay . it abounds with high production values : john toll ' s award - winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick ' s 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names . but this does not save a misguided script . the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer ' s only response to his "" heroism "" is intellectual : william wallace ( producer - director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him . but wallace ' s actions paint a different story . he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance . though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king . wallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance . after kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england . this is evident of a "" spartacus complex "" , and this example applies both historically and cinematically . the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay . it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film . horner ' s score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help . gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him . this drags down any emotional connection to the film ' s plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time .",neg,be great anticipation sit view braveheart last week premiere american cable academy award win film have be highly acclaimed also feature music favorite film composer jame horner be be disappointing overlong film be good picture drag braveheart be screenplay abound high production value john toll award win cinematography also grace edward zwick legend fall gorgeous score horner sort logistic make wish assistant director be household name do save misguided script film wish paint central character hero viewer only response heroism be intellectual william wallace producer director mel gibson be fight freedom tyranny so have root wallace action paint different story speak freedom act vengeance intellectually realize wallace be right side film paint unconvincing emotional portait wallace be just as bad english king wallace speak freedom act point vengeance kick english scotland decide invade england be evident spartacus complex example apply historically cinematically historical spartacus point move liberate slave sack roman city film spartacus braveheart have high production value competent performace be drag awful screenplay be shame excellent score be part terrible film horner score try make emotional connection performance script do help gibson portray wallace way audience relate identify drag emotional connection film plot turn hour total waste time

139,"i cried during _babe_ . i admit it . the special effects , the story , the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a "" children ' s film "" -- so much so that , yes , i got a little overly sentimental . such , my friend , is the power of cinema . when word came out that they were using this newly developed f / x for a doctor dolittle update , in which eddie murphy plays the title character , and many great comic actors supply the voices , my anticipation rose to great expectations . they can ' t possibly drop the ball on this one . can ' t miss . can ' t possibly miss . they missed . what went wrong ? after much thought , i supply three general rules . ( 1 ) don ' t let a television actress - turned - comedy movie director near an urbanite script ( i . e . , penny marshall ' s dreadful "" preacher ' s wife "" ) . betty thomas worked wonders with "" the brady bunch movie "" , but the same sitcom - airiness doesn ' t quite work here . it ' s as if she lifted a generic sitcom , and iced it with light doses of modern r & b . take away the black cast , take away the atrocious soundtrack , and you have the residue of some mid - 80 ' s kirk cameron show . ( 2 ) the greater the cast , the less the individual cast - member has to do ( i . e . , "" con air "" ) . it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman , garry schandling , john leguizimo , ellen degeneres , and gilbert godfried in your lineup , but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped , stereotyped characters , one - line - at - a - time . it ' s even worse , because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don ' t get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits . now there are three character actors who do get special treatment : albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he ' s in , and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy . norm mcdonald fares nearly as well , as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle . but there ' s little humor here . that rests on the shoulders of chris rock , sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise - ass guinea pig . even the mouth is ill - synched .

141,""" the animal "" is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling . it ' s clunky and slow , like watching an 18 - wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill . there are certainly better things you can do with your time . actually , if you ' ve seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments . the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer . but he ' s afflicted with loser - itis . dogs attack him , neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co - workers ignore him . truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we ' d probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun . this is actually bad because you can ' t like a character if you can ' t develop sympathy for him . we never do , and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor . however , marvin is found by an eccentric doctor ( michael caton ) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him , implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs . as a result , marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed . he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body , swim with the speed of a dolphin , and can run as fast as a cheetah . imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation . with his enhanced abilities , he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him . however , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn , and instead , marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic , sexual urges . goats beware ! he also chases cats , urinates to mark his territory , or growls at his enemies . what he should ' ve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich . equally tenuous is its other running joke , which involves one of his friends ( guy torry ) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he ' s black . "" it ' s reverse racism , "" he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything . this element doesn ' t work the first time it ' s mentioned , and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence . you don ' t have to be as wise as an owl to realize that "" the animal "" is tame . if there ' s any reason to see this film , it ' s to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut . remember her ? she was voted off in week 11 of the 13 - week program , "" survivor .

142,"harmless , silly and fun comedy about dim - witted wrestling fans gordie and sean ( david arquette and scott caan ) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king ( oliver platt ) . when king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter ( joe pantoliano ) , gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory . my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on , as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed ( but not fake , mind you ) . the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that . arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances , which is exactly what a movie like this requires , and oliver platt ( one of my favorite actors ) is a riot as the drunken washed - up ex - champion . many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record , but for me it just added to the "" silly factor "" of the film , thereby increasing my enjoyment of it . one casting complaint however : rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer ? please . . . if rose mcgowan is sexy then i ' m marilyn manson . given the current state of the actual wcw , if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming , he ' d be the most popular guy they have . on a similar note , the "" plot line "" of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up with in the last two years . although one does have to ask . . . why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans ? director brian robbins ( you ' ll remember him as eric from tv ' s "" head of the class "" ) just knows how to make good dumb movies . this movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger and varsity blues . and screenwriter steven brill ( the epic mighty ducks trilogy , late last night ) manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same time , with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me . the only exceptions to that were : 1 ) a scene involving a van full of singing nuns and 2 ) any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan . those moments made me cringe and / or groan . as an added bonus though , the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits roll .

144,"the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made . i know that is very sweeping statement , so i ' ll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of "" science fiction , "" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot . 2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . most all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting . the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high - tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town . something bad happens to them . pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight . apparently everyone in the town is dead . the authorities call a "" wildfire alert , "" summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super - secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada . two of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins . some went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive . they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a "" directive 712 , "" an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb . what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth - like life and mutates as it grows . their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict . what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a - bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet . they barely call off the bombing in time . but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out . this triggers the lab ' s last - ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb . to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow . much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts . but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw . the performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low - key and restrained , just like scientists . to me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting . we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don ' t expect . this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it . it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body ' s wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood .",pos,andromeda strain be great science fiction film ever make know be very sweeping statement ' qualify add andromeda strain be few film make genuinely deserve label science fiction story speculative science be core plot space odyssey be probably well film really only qualifie science fiction consider metaphysic be science most other film normally classify science fiction sf be really just fantasy action horror story set futuristic setting andromeda strain start soldier high tech van look crashed satellite tiny new mexico town bad happen picture reconnaissance plane show shocking sight apparently town be dead authority call wildfire alert summon scientist somewhat reluctant super -

147,"arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts , since the late 80 ' s , but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one - liners are getting worse . it ' s hard seeing arnold as mr . freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes , but hey he got 15 million , what ' s it matter to him ? once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that can ' t compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser . in this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself ) . with the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world ! parts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma . yes , the film is that weak , but it ' s better than the other blockbuster right now ( sleepy hollow ) , but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film . anyway , this definitely doesn ' t seem like an arnold movie . it just wasn ' t the type of film you can see him doing . sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one - liners , but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going . it ' s understandable , especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources . aside form that , he still walked through it , much like he has in the past few films . i ' m sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days . speaking of action , where was it in this film ?

148,"the most amazing thing about paul cox ' s innocence is how unlike a movie it is . i mean that as the highest compliment . if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40 - year - old romance , i ' d want to run and hide . the sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters ' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence . along with a charming romantic story , the australian / belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable . the romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles "" bud "" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby . they decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair . complicating matters is andreas ' frail health , and claire ' s longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can ' t understand why he ' s suddenly become obsolete . in my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved . john , claire ' s husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong . claire initially insists she ' s a grown - up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her . andreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence . cox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train . it ' s a reminder of andreas and claire ' s past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed . a pall is cast on the whole affair . a master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments . in andreas ' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire ' s love . we also get glimpses into john and claire ' s relationship . during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could . all that ' s heard is the scraping of forks against plates . the characters are unlike anything i ' ve seen -- they ' re people . so many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky . or they ' re reduced to comedic buffoons . ordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren ' t sure what the next step is . they do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they ' ve known throughout their adult lives . bravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire ' s affair is automatically justified . norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire ' s love difficult to accept . we feel for him . he ' s a decent man . sure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now . with so much presented to the audience , it ' s only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does . however , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ?

149,"in intolerance , d . w . griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other . each of the stories builds to a fast - paced climax . in magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others . yet the stories and where they are going are all independent . what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized . each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve . while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene . then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again . it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked . this creates some strange effects . the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships . the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content . we have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends . phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal . partridge ' s young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason . frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self - help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit - heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women ' s lib . officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place . jimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children ' s tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h . macy ) . the film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily . each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story . the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories . the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event . magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories . it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson ' s company . john c . reilly seems to be a standard fixture . particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight . here he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used . as studies of characters these stories are each worth following . as well - rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired . but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through . i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low + 2 on the - 4 to + 4 scale . heavy spoiler . . . heavy spoiler . . . heavy spoiler . . . heavy spoiler . . . during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen . and in actual fact , it does . since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods . it is , however , a perfectly natural , if somewhat unnerving , phenomenon . the cause is associated with whirlwinds . we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air , holding them aloft . the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister . smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are . when the whirlwind is over water , animals near the surface , frequently fish and frogs , may suffer the same fate . essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind , held aloft by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere . so while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in . the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs . it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped . it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon . ( frankly i have no idea on these points . ) otherwise the event was quite believable . what we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano . in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 . "" and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants . "" however a rain of frogs , though it feels biblical , is most definitely not a biblical portent . note that the previous verse says "" and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up . . . , "" so the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river . the only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16 : 13 .",pos,intolerance d griffith tell different historical story same time cut other story build fast pace climax magnolia paul thoma anderson tell several story just tangentially connected other story where be go be all independent be strange story be be all synchronize story build tense moment appear be intend be tense moment then let tension dissolve tension dissipate character start singe song plotline major character sing even be same scene then end story build tense moment again be almost character be somehow psychically link create strange effect story be empty desperate people dysfunctional relationship strand have vary degree bizarre content have story die man earl partridge jason robard want get touch son make amend phil parma philip seymour hoffman be nurse be frantic help partridge achieve final goal partridge young wife linda julianne moore be get more more anxious partridge die unsuspected reason frank mackey tom cruise run kind self help seminar business like so much aim teaching disaffect man how be real shit heel deal woman angry backlash woman s lib officer jim kurring john c reilly be patrolman have need feel be make world well place jimmy gator philip baker hall host popular child s tv quiz show really exploit destroy child see story current quiz kid stanley spector jeremy blackman former quiz kid donnie smith william h macy film juggle story hour even time story be resolve satisfactorily story move single bizarre common climax be seem do much derail story common climax be ambiguous many way fail really tie story film seem be build strange event weird history really have little do content story be connect part weird event magnolia probably bring much deserve attention paul thoma anderson opinion previous film hard boogie night be well tell story be interesting start look forward actor anderson company john c reilly seem be standard fixture particularly notable be philip baker hall give mesmerizing performance first scene hard here several character be mesmerize characteristic be really use study character story be worth follow as well rounded story beginning middle end leave be desire film be willing do unexpected help make film worth sit through rate scale low + scale heavy spoiler heavy spoiler heavy spoiler heavy spoiler strange climactic event film get multiple message filmmaker event be see really do happen actual fact do biblical time rain frog have be interpret sign displeasure god be however perfectly natural somewhat unnerving phenomenon cause be associate whirlwind know tornado land rip land even object size ground hurl air hold aloft reader remember unfortunate cow twister small object be hurl high atmosphere then be keep aloft updraft surprisingly long period time much hail chunk ice be when whirlwind be water animal surface frequently fish frog suffer same fate essentially be vacuum whirlwind hold aloft updraft finally drop elsewhere so rain be possible doubt do creep rain frog depict film be great scale have picture rain frog seem unlikely frog still be alive when drop be clear geographic condition be right los angele have sort phenomenon frankly have idea point otherwise event be quite believable see film be much more credible phenomena see volcano film be leave ambiguous rain be sign god be many reference exodus frog come people servant however rain frog feel biblical be most definitely biblical portent note previous verse say river bring frog abundantly go so bible be refer rain infestation river only other reference frog bible be symbol uncleanness revelation

155,"what is freedom ? how does one determine who is free ? in 1839 , those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now . yet , the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations . that is , in essence , what steven spielberg ' s gripping drama "" amistad "" is about . through its various dramas , spielberg presents a case about a group of africans , who , after being seized from their home , were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard "" la amistad "" . on their way there , the slaves , led by cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , rebelled , killing off part of the crew . however , the ship was still directed towards the united states , where the africans were brought to trial under murder . in the court , various factions claim ownership of the slaves , and therefore try to seize them away . the united states government , led by president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , and secretary of state secretary forsyth ( david paymer ) , try to ship the africans to spain , where an 11 year old isabella ii ( anna paquin ) wants them back . the two spaniards who own "" la amistad "" want the slaves for themselves . the american ship that found the slaves also wants them . in the midst of this are two abolitionists ( stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman ) , who want the slaves to be free . they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey , who tries to free them . through various legal proceedings , the case appears before the supreme court , where it is argued by ex - president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . the film itself is a visual wonder . spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark , somber mood when appropriate , and a visual setting when appropriate as well . at times , the film is very slow , and very methodical . however , spielberg is not at his finest here , because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag . the film is , in essence , a courtroom drama , one whose events are oversimplified . the characterization is also weak , displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin ( mcconaughey ) , and especially morgan freeman ' s abolitionist . but spielberg ' s finest work in the film , the opening scene , a scene of cinque ' s family , and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america , is altogether stunning . it is this emotional force that carries the film . mcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans , hopkins is sensational as the old adams , freeman is outstanding when used ( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents ) , and the rest of the cast is stellar . the movie , however , belongs to hounsou . his emotional intensity is brilliant . spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou , and the film ' s extraordinary power is simply captivating . the film is flawed , for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard . but that doesn ' t matter . the story is a gripping one , and one of extreme importance . kudos to spielberg for finding it , finding the right men for the job , and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque . a good job all around .",pos,be freedom how do determine be free question be more difficult answer then be now yet mistake forefather be examine order rectify current situation that is essence steven spielberg grip drama amistad be various drama spielberg present case group african be seize home be force ship send united state la amistad way there slave lead cinque djimon hounsou rebel kill part crew however ship be still direct united state where african be bring trial murder court various faction claim ownership slave therefore try seize away united state government lead president martin van buren nigel hawthorne secretary state secretary forsyth david paymer try ship african spain where year old isabella ii anna paquin want back spaniard own la amistad want slave american ship find slave also want midst be abolitionist stellan skaarsgard morgan freeman want slave be free enlist help lawyer matthew mcconaughey try free various legal proceeding case appear supreme court where be argue ex -

158,"every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre : with dramas , it was citizen kane , with arthouse it was pulp fiction , and with comedy it was , well , that jim carrey guy ( okay , so he ' s not a movie , but he did have a huge influence on the genre . not to mention an expensive one . ) sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big , sprawling motion picture event , as did forrest gump four years ago . with action films , it was aliens , whic was released to much hype seven years after it ' s equally - innovative parent , alien ( 1979 ) . directed and written by james cameron ( t2 : judgement day , the abyss , true lies ) , the authority on action films , it was a masterful encore to his sci - fi thriller the terminator ( 1984 ) . while the original alien film was a dark , enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew , james cameron took the big - budget action film with aliens , which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing , although on a much - larger scale . and boy , did he take that route ! i ' d say at about 165 mph or so . . . the film opens 57 years after the original , with lt . ripley ( weaver ) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel . if you ' ll recall , at the end of alien ripley , the only surviving member , cryogenically "" hibernated "" herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship . unfortunately , she thought she ' d only be out for a couple of weeks . . . once she ' s returned to earth , ripley is quickly interrogated by "" the company "" , who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy . in truth , they believe her , as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an "" alien advisor "" . it seems that the colony planet was a once - breeding ground for the nasty aliens , and now all communication with the planet has been lost . . . it doesn ' t exactly take a genius to guess what happens next : ripley agrees , and before you can say "" big mistake "" , she and the half dozen marines , plus the slimy corporate guy ( reiser ) , who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve , are off to the colony . when they arrive , they find the planet in ruins . only one survivor is found , a little girl , newt , who confirms that , yes , the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system . and soon enough , the marines come under attack from the aliens . . . what happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci - fi movie : the action scenes . cameron directs them so skillfully , and so suspensefully , that you ' re literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around . which features , in my opinion , the best fight scene ever recorded on film , as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death . many people will tell you that this film , while being a great action film , has no real drama and is all cliches . well , they would be wrong , my friends . if this film had no "" drama "" , then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards ?

159,"house on haunted hill ( 1999 ) starring taye diggs , geoffrey rush , ali larter , famke janssen , peter gallagher , bridgette wilson , max perlich , lisa loeb , james marsters , and chris kattan . directed by william malone , written by dick beebe , "" house on haunted hill "" initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie - like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible . one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck . a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water . these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b - horror flicks , with grunting noises and cadaverous movements . except this time , at the end of the millenium , the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be . in past horror films , the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims . "" house on haunted hill "" doesn ' t want their audience to have an imagination , everything is provided for them to watch and squirm , not think . this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film . "" house on haunted hill "" , which is based on the 1958 film of the same title , introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can , following the opening blood fest . the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot . the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling , unexpected shots of blood , guts , and mayhem . however , the film is neither scary nor unpredictable . the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush ) . each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money . since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring , the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them . the problem is that every character is not likable . the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter ) . the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic , that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them . the worst character in this film , or maybe in any film released this year , is chris kattan ' s watson pritchett . he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate , that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself . waiting for pritchett to die , was a strenuously difficult act to sit through . the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price ( an homage to victor price who starred in the original ) . playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party , he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face . however , rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price , played by famke janssen . the main problem is that "" house on haunted hill "" is not scary . to top off that huge disappointment , every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous . if the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped ( similar to "" deep blue sea "" ) , the goal for creating a creepy , suspenseful action film was completely missed .",neg,house haunted hill star taye digg geoffrey rush ali lart famke janssen peter gallagher bridgette wilson max perlich lisa loeb jame marster chris kattan direct william malone write dick beebe house haunted hill initialize audience scene involve zombie like mental patient attack murder doctor gory way possible doctor be kill instantly have pencil ram completely neck nurse have head force barrel water mob zombie present be previous horror flick grunt noise cadaverous movement time end millenium film be give power show exactly how horrific creature be past horror film actual murder scene be leave show force viewer assume own nasty bloody death hapless victim house haunted hill doesn t want audience have imagination be provide watch squirm think nonsense violence throw nowhere be unfortunately most refreshing part film house haunted hill be base film same title introduce handful character as quickly follow opening blood f film have intention provide character development laudable plot aim here be scare audience chilling unexpected shot blood gut mayhem however film be scary unpredictable plot involve people be dare spend night haunted house dollar amusement park owner geoffrey rush character be failure external world acknowledge do money character be immediately generalize greedy care expectation survive be kill minute meet problem be character be likable come close be civilized be womanizer taye digg be do film lot well talent businesswoman accept be womanize lart character present be so annoying pathetic be hard cheer scream bad character film maybe film release year be chris kattan s watson pritchett spend whole film whine spooky house tone irritating inappropriate unintentionally begin seem more evil house wait pritchett die be strenuously difficult act sit most humorous actor bunch be geoffrey rush play steven price homage victor price star original play rich man supposedly organize party play role perfectly twisted way where be obvious be just expression face however rush be pretty much waste confusing subplot involve hateful marriage evelyn price play famke janssen main problem be house haunted hill be scary top huge disappointment actor be waste script be completely ludicrous annoying character hilariously bad dialogue be intentionally underdeveloped similar deep blue sea goal create creepy suspenseful action film be completely miss

"" in all cases , and in "" o brother , "" too , the characters populating their films are three - dimensional people . ulysses everett is a handsome , hair - obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department . but , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $ 1 . 2 million . their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer ' s original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money . there is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens . the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys ' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow . some of the interludes are an epiphany , though . the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar - playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root ) . they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , "" i am a man of constant sorrow . "" it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us , in my mind , the best movie song of the year . contrasting this and other wonderful moments ( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind ) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of "" o brother . "" in particular , near the end , is a scene where ulysses , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched . the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of "" the wizard of oz . "" they don ' t say "" lions and tigers and bears , oh my ! "" and there ' s no dorothy , but it is the land of oz we ' re seeing here . the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels . george clooney is funny , charming , a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today . he has the charm of a 30 ' s movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity . ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair , risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets . his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero - wanderer . while clooney is the name draw for "" o brother , "" the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar . the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who , at one point , hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism . delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine . the taciturn pete , as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro , is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst . all together , the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons , albeit brave ones . the colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys ' odyssey . charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy o ' daniel , who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for re - election . john goodman is wicked as the one - eyed bible salesman and con artist , big dan teague . michael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary , george "" babyface "" nelson . stephen root is amusing as the blind dj , rep ' ing one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways . holly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses ' estranged wife , penny ( and the real reason for this adventure , not secret treasure ) . techs are , as expected in a coen brothers venture , first class . cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked on five previous coen films , captures the sultry atmosphere of the south . the photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres , respectively . once again , roderick jaynes - the alter ego of ethan and joel coen - is on board as editor . the high points outweigh the low through most of "" o brother , where art thou ?

165,"mike myers , you certainly did throw us a ? frickin ' bone here in what you call ? the biggest austin powers adventure yet . ' austin powers : the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers : international man of mystery . many are skeptical about sequels , saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original , but austin powers : tswsm goes beyond the first film . austin powers : the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles . he reprises his role as the title character , austin powers , the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 , and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr . evil , also played by mike myers , from destroying the earth . tswsm leaves off where the original stopped , with dr . evil ' s ? frisch ' s big boy ' space capsule floating through space . dr . evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule , plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 , in which he plans to steal austin powers ' "" mojo "" , what keeps austin going with spy talents . upon his return to his secret lair , which is now a starbucks coffee shop , dr . evil learns that his evil henchman , which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau , have created a 1 / 8 size clone of dr . evil , which is later named mini me . the evil mini me replaces scott evil , played by seth green , as dr . evil ' s son in the madman ' s mind , because dr . evil thinks of scott to be only "" quasi - evil . "" dr . evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him , and now he has one . dr . evil tells mini me , "" you complete me , "" in a loving manner . dr . evil loving ? wow ! mike myers ' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr . evil ' s , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers ' frozen body . austin powers learns of dr . evil ' s trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it . once arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his "" pad "" , his smashing home / dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr . evil . as the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr . evil , for example , "" don ' t go there , girlfriend ! "" to the president of the united states . many witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid - they ' re funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes . take for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is . the way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing . there was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn ' t laughing . the last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers ! it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it . the film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , "" it ' s funny how england and southern california look nothing alike . "" tswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england . i can tell you one thing - he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters . i believe that dr . evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did . dr . evil provided more laughs , more memorable moments , and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around , who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film . i felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myers , not fat bastard . also making a great addition to the series is mini me , who is played by verne troyer . even though the midget actor is 30 years old , he is adorable by dr . evil ' s side constantly . the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality , such as lack of character development , barely any detailed plot characteristics , and barely any good acting , but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor . mike myers , with his three roles , acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor , disguising himself completely in one of the roles . ( fat bastard ) all three characters are different , and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them . heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm , and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a very flat performance in the original , speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion . speaking of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments . hopefully , graham tags along for future austin powers adventures . the bottom line - a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing .",pos,mike myer certainly do throw frickin bone here call big austin power adventure yet austin power spy shag be sequel smash comedy austin power international man mystery many be skeptical sequel say sequel be never well as good original austin power tswsm go first film austin power spy shag star mike myer different role reprise role title character austin power shagadelic spy body be freeze unfrozen stop long time nemesis dr evil also play mike myer destroy earth tswsm leave where original stop dr evil s frisch big boy space capsule float space evil return back earth eject capsule plot go back time machine year plan steal austin power mojo keep austin go spy talent return secret lair be now starbuck coffee shop dr evil learn evil henchman include return robert wagner number mindy sterling frau have create size clone dr evil be later name mini evil mini replace scott evil play seth green dr evil son madman s mind evil think scott be only quasi - evil evil have always want son be evil just now have evil tell mini complete love manner evil loving mike myer third role be fat bastard scottish henchman dr evil s be send steal mojo austin power frozen body austin power learn dr evil trip back 60 use own time machine take back try save mojo fat bastard get hold once arrive year austin travel pad smash home dance club where meet felicity shagwell play heather graham cia agent be willing help journey stop dr evil film progress hilarious liner be throw mainly dr evil example don t go there girlfriend president united state many witty gag take place note entire tent scene just plain funny scene be so stupid ' re funny come dozen minute take example scott evil go jerry springer show complain how evil father be way austin power tswsm use humor be clever throw hilarious scene follow minute liner follow outrageous scene so never stop laugh be honestly moment austin power tswsm where wasn t laugh last film laugh so hard in be well austin power be apparent mike myer know how funny film be write film even make fun line line ' s funny how england southern california look alike tswsm be film southern california be suppose take place england tell thing be have lot fun enormously popular character be all television newspaper magazine movie theater believe dr evil get more attention tswsm austin power do dr evil provide more laugh more memorable moment more interesting dialogue austin do time seem miss funny touch have first film feel austin really do have mojo take away screenplay writer mike myer fat bastard also make great addition series be mini be play verne troyer even midget actor be year old be adorable dr evil side constantly first austin power film have barely sentimental quality such lack character development barely detailed plot characteristic barely good acting austin power tswsm actually show quality frequent humor mike myer role act eddie murphy do nutty professor disguise completely role fat bastard character be different mike myer do do good job handle heather graham make great addition talent tswsm do much well job elizabeth hurley do give very flat performance original speak line feeling emotion speak hurley be see tswsm few brief moment hopefully graham tag future austin power adventure bottom line groovy sequel mike myer put mojo writing
166,"when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don ' t think that they are completely to blame for this movie ' s failure . it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the "" unseen "" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny . so special effects or not , if the story isn ' t the least bit scary , you aren ' t going to end up with a very frightening movie . the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern . dern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie . as i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern ' s caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast . never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie . liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear . he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion . he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia . and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings - on . catherine zeta - jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects . like the original , taylor ' s character is the star of the movie . but since she doesn ' t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta - jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original . and let ' s face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta - jones . i ' ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren ' t in it . but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets . they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients . there really isn ' t much of a story here . just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with . and the special effects are great . in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere . in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the "" cool shots "" quota . at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe . but not scary . then we have the set . when i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it . but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route . this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves . what part did these rooms play in the story ? absolutely none . they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . then we have the actors . lili taylor has never been one of my favorites . and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . i have no idea why liam neeson took this role . he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . zeta - jones was cast because she is too hot for words . the fact that her character is bi - sexual is just icing on the cake . all catherine has to do in this movie is look good . fortunately that is something she does very well . while she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye - candy . it ' s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999 ' s horror movies , the blair witch project . the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . if the story sucks , it ' s all downhill from there . my advice ? if you are looking for special effects , go rent star wars . if it ' s scares you want , rent halloween . either way , it ' s probably in your best interests to skip the haunting .",neg,when haunting arrive theater keep hear be overdone special effect fact very often unseen bump night horror film be far scarier put face courtesy special effect agree remake haunting go bit overboard visual effect department don t think be completely blame movie failure appear people have fail take account original haunting have unseen terror be about as scary dust bunny so special effect story isn t least bit scary aren t go end very frightening movie thing interest most movie be caretaker building play bruce dern dern be always great even have have only about minute screen time be still most interesting element movie sit seemingly endless fairly impressive special effect keep wish movie be dern caretaker dimensional character populate cast never good sign when bit player be good part movie liam neeson play scientist be conduct experiment fear decide good way get result be trick group fairly unstable individual spend few day haunted mansion trick participate let be conduct experiment insomnia also fail mention mansion have reputation strange going on catherine zeta jones lili taylor owen wilson play subject original taylor character be star movie doesn t quite have marquee power liam neeson ms zeta jones part do seem be big large original let s face probably people see movie do so zeta jones ' admit have never see thing weren t real star here be special effect combine fairly overdone set take movie supernatural element house start interact hapless insomnia patient really t much story here just endless setup director jan bont showcase nifty special effect get play special effect be great many case be as good be likely see anywhere other case be overdone obviously throw just sake hit cool shot quota point movie do thing ever come close be scary funny maybe scary then have set when first see house be very impressed very cool gothic look only take short tour character place see set designer obviously have as much money burn visual effect people do decide take idiotically overdone route include flooded hallway book stepping stone mirror circular room revolve part do room play story absolutely none be just there take mind fact be descent story single scare entire movie then have actor lili taylor have never be favorite when fact character be mousy pathetic be factor come average slightly mark have idea why liam neeson take role basically remind ringmaster out control circus character be charge farce quickly get away have doubt liam want lock print movie very secure vault copy darkman zeta jones be cast be too hot word fact character be bi - sexual be just ice cake catherine have do movie be look good fortunately be do very well do have fairly good size part be obvious only purpose movie be eye candy ' s too bad talent waste here random supermodel pull fashion show have easily fill role haunting be antithesis horror movie blair witch project haunting have seemingly limitless effect budget blair witch rely pile rock scare prove quite nicely special effect be irrelevant horror film story suck ' s downhill there advice be look special effect go rent star war ' scare want rent halloween way ' s probably good interest skip haunting

169,"clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976 ' s murder by death . this big screen version of the classic board game ( what ' s next . . . chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue . the plot , for what it ' s worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr . boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who ' s been blackmailing them all . when he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit . . . and in what room , and with what object . while not as witty as neil simon ' s murder by death , clue definitely has it moments . it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i ' m joking around with my friends . to this day , whenever someone says the phrase "" well , to make a long story short "" i have the follow up phrase "" too late "" ready to go . the cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs . white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest . and colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well . clue is available on dvd from paramount home video . it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer . a french language audio track is also available . the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not , and it even includes a scene not in the film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film , as it ' s a good joke ) . also , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane ! , which was an interesting choice . when clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings . if you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times . so when the film was released on home video , rather than releasing three separate videos , all three endings were included on one tape . . . the first two endings being "" what if ?

171,"the crown jewel of 1970 ' s irwin allen disaster movies , the poseidon adventure features an all - star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship . the story begins on the u . s . s . poseidon ' s big new year ' s cruise , where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive . let ' s see , there ' s the new age preacher ( hackman ) who advises people to "" pray to that part of god within yourself . "" there ' s the ex - cop ( borgnine ) who busted a hooker ( stella stevens ) six times -- then married her . there ' s the hippie singer ( "" there ' s got to be a morning after . . . "" ) who turns to the company of a lonely man ( red buttons ) once her brother is killed . and to round out the group : the elderly couple ( jack albertson and shelley winters ) who live aboard the ship , the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall . we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure , before straight - faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship . everyone ' s in the giant ballroom at the time , shortly past midnight of the new year , when the ship turns first on its side , then completely upside down . the second - in - command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives , but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship . in this case , because the ship is overturned , the top is the bottom . or is the bottom the top ? either way , we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and -- in the ballroom scene -- christmas trees . thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors , through burning rooms , etc . while the ship slowly fills with water behind them . it ' s a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting . the poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at , with all the melodrama that comes in - between the non - thrilling action scenes . the one note in borgnine ' s one - note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love ( although since there isn ' t a sex scene , we never find out if his buttons really are red ) and albertson and winters wonder if they ' ll live to see their grandson ' s birth . shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end , where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along . winters , who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie ( stevens even not - so - affectionately calls her "" fatass "" in one scene ) , finally finds her purpose . "" i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen , "" she brags , and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years , she ' s swimming through the water , her skirt billowing up around her hips , showing off her cellulite ( or do you call it shellulite ? ) ridden thighs . it ' s not so much funny as innately disgusting , which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole .",neg,crown jewel irwin allen disaster movie poseidon adventure feature star cast include gene hackman ernest borgnine spout most laughable dramatic dialogue movie history trap cruise ship story begin u poseidon big new year cruise where be introduce ensemble people soon be only passenger leave alive let s see s new age preacher hackman advise people pray part god s ex - cop borgnine bust hooker stella steven time then marry s hippie singer s get be morning after turn company lonely man red button once brother be kill round group elderly couple jack albertson shelley winter live ship beautiful teenage girl brother be sail alone adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall get know people little too well first minute poseidon adventure straight face ship captain leslie nielson look horror giant tidal wave head right ship s giant ballroom time shortly midnight new year when ship turn first side then completely upside down second command want wait ballroom help arrive rebel hackman lead small band follower quest top ship case ship be overturn top be bottom be bottom top way get see lot bottom beautiful woman crew be conveniently wear hot pant scene where camera shoot upwards climb ladder ballroom scene christmas tree thus begin hour more hush trip long corridor burn room ship slowly fill water ' s race clock be only mildly interesting poseidon adventure work more bad movie laugh melodrama come non - thrilling action scene note borgnine note performance be be cranky old man argue hackman step way button hippie fall love isn t sex scene never find button really be red albertson winter wonder ' live see grandson birth shelley winter provide most hilarious scene movie scene end where water have flood next room ship hackman be prepare dive rope rest pull along winter have be whiny fat woman movie steven even so affectionately call fatass scene finally find purpose be underwater swimming champ new york year run when be brag hackman even ask how be year ' swim water skirt billow hip show cellulite do call shellulite ridden thigh ' s so much funny innately disgusting pretty much sum poseidon adventure whole
172,"anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon ' s fact based novel the king and i , and it ' s big , expensive and soulless . though good - looking , its lavish sets , fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson ' s script . so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting . this is jodie foster ' s first movie since the jaw - droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn ' t the best choice to show off her acting chops . she ' s trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens , the uptight , widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king ' s ( chow yun - fat ) son in the ways of the west ( because "" the ways of england are the ways of the world ) . the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive , no ? ) . the eldest prince is none too happy about this ( "" father , have i offended you in some way ? why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern - mother - who - loves - you personality better and comes to like her . meanwhile , siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma . the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain ' s doing which arouses suspicion in siam , putting anna in an uncomfortable position . she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king ' s prejudices . he , though self - righteous as ever , can ' t help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly , quietly , develop affections for each other . there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king ' s younger daughters dies . it ' s your classic deathbed scene , with the girl ' s mournful eyes staring at her father , who tries only semi - successfully to maintain his composure . anna then comes in and cries a bit . the sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer . i ' m usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched . this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren . we never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care . this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorites of 1998 . i do not doubt tennant ' s ability to put together a decent movie , but anna and the king , aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient . the sets and scenery are gorgeous , but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur . even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $ 75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia . we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger - than - life awe . i liked both foster and yun - fat , who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles . foster ' s generally stoic persona serves her well here , as she is playing a reserved , formal and rather underdeveloped character . yun - fat is especially effective , perfectly conveying the king of siam ' s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts . what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations . the cast is great , the director is talented , and the budget is lavish , but this ill - advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole . this is an emotionless costume epic .",neg,anna king be least fourth film adaptation margaret landon fact base novel king ' big expensive soulless good look lavish set fancy costume luscious cinematography do little compensate emotional wasteland be peter krike steve meerson s script so much money be spend pretty picture forget actually make movie interesting be jodie foster first movie jaw droppingly brilliant contact come more year ago isn good choice show act chop ' s trap stoic role anna leonowen uptight widow british schoolteacher come siam now thailand son instruct king chow yun fat son way west way england be way world king like so much put charge educate whole royal family kid more way impressive eld prince be none too happy father have offend way why do punish imperialist schoolteacher soon get know anna stern mother love personality well come like meanwhile siam come attack neighboring british colony burma king close advisor suspect be britain do arouse suspicion siam put anna uncomfortable position be sure make seem suspect british involvement crisis work diffuse king prejudice self righteous ever ' t help be influence eloquent anna slowly quietly develop affection other be scene middle anna king where king young daughter die ' s classic deathbed scene girl mournful eye stare father try only semi - successfully maintain composure anna then come cry bit sequence be there purpose evoke strong emotional response viewer ' m usually sucker such scene yet time be just sit there emotion untouched remain true movie remain emotionally barren never develop connection character never give reason care ludicrously long epic be direct andy tennant last film be ever after favorite do doubt tennant ability put together decent movie anna king aside be psychologically inept be also technologically deficient set scenery be gorgeous camerawork do convey grandeur even terrence malick manage do more flora fauna otherwise abysmal thin red line tennant muster worth prop shoot malaysia feel camera be restrict immediate point view be wide tracking shot sweep zoom fill large life awe like foster yun fat give entertaining terribly involve performance lead role foster generally stoic persona serve well here be play reserved formal rather underdeveloped character yun fat be especially effective perfectly convey king siam sangfroid permeate violent outburst do anna king be inability involve viewer character situation cast be great director be talente budget be lavish ill advise remake classic roger hammerstein movie be unable utilize thing form compelling whole be emotionless costume epic

"" owing to the increased occurrence of turpin ' s robberies , captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners ( kenneth williams ) and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp ( jack douglas ) visit turpin ' s area of influence to bring him to justice . they are under the express orders of sir roger daley ( bernard bresslaw ) . their intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin ( sid james ) , whom they confided in earlier , they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies . however , once they catch harriett and put her in jail , and sir roger daley takes complete charge , it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin . then again , sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable ( kenneth connor ) to keep an eye on their prisoner ! there is no doubt that this is a ' sid james ' carry on movie . he excels in double roles ( as in ' carry on - don ' t lose your head ' ) and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious . barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang , and hattie jacques ' small but effective role as the rector ' s housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection . jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on - screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part . peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom , and bernard bresslaw ' s character appears only briefly in the film . the only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree , who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the ' birds of paradise ' and sporting a fake french accent . when her girls and her are robbed by turpin , she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit ! a carry on by the numbers , this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie . the jokes are bluer , the script is poorer ( it is the last script written by talbot rothwell ) , but the music is a marked improvement . although nearly all the regulars appear , they seem to be just going through the motions . none of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here . just a selection of crude jokes and repititive double - entendres .",neg,be last carry film almost intact regular cast be swansong hattie jacque sid jame dick turpin sid jame gang include harriett harry barbara windsor tom scholl peter butterworth terrorise countryside stage highway robbery stand deliver owe increase occurrence turpin robbery captain desmond fancey bow street runner kenneth william sidekick sergeant jock strapp jack douglas visit turpin s area influence bring justice be express order sir roger daley bernard bresslaw intellect do count much when increasingly become suspicious reverend flasher aka dick turpin sid jame confide early still believe rector have part robbery however catch harriett put jail sir roger daley take complete charge seem be hope dick turpin then again sir roger have assign dimwit fancey jock strapp aswell old dithering constable kenneth connor keep eye prisoner be doubt be sid jame carry movie excel double role carry don t lose head performance flasher turpin be hilarious barbara windsor be also funny harriett sex mad housemaid member gang hattie jacque small effective role rector housekeeper martha hoggett be play perfection jack douglas play milder version excruciatingly annoying screen persona kenneth william be give rather mundane part peter butterworth be allow shine boring performance tom bernard bresslaw character appear only briefly film only notable performance support cast come joan sim madame desiree be travel country escort starlet bird paradise sport fake french accent when girl be rob turpin be determined catch help reverend find culprit carry number movie be only notable great performance sid jame last carry movie joke be bluer script be poor be last script write talbot rothwell music be marked improvement nearly regular appear seem be just go motion none high spirit early film be apparent here just selection crude joke repititive double entendre

176,"so , it ' s thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again . that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn ' t for the fact that the "" odd couple "" of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993 ' s "" grumpy old men , "" 1995 ' s "" grumpier old men , "" and 1997 ' s "" out to sea "" ( i . e . "" grumpiest old men "" ) . so , "" the odd couple ii "" ( i . e . "" the grumpiest old men of all , really "" ) seems just another entry in a tired series . the plot is even similar to that of "" grumpy old men "" in that lemmon and matthau ' s mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children . oscar ' s son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix ' s daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car . . . then hilarity ensues . well , a few chuckles ensue anyway . neil simon , the award - winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end . unlike the original play / movie , "" odd couple ii "" doesn ' t find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters . instead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of "" cybill "" and jean smart of "" designing women "" ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert . the original 1968 movie "" the odd couple "" remains a classic comedy . it introduced the motif of roommate - as - spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since . it was the second outing for the lemmon / matthau team ( which debuted in 1966 ' s "" the fortune cookie "" ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , "" the front page "" ( 1974 ) and "" buddy buddy "" ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways . the reunion of lemmon and matthau in "" grumpy old men "" six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie . but "" out to sea "" and "" the odd couple ii "" are just beating a grumpy old horse .

177,"jean - luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the crew of the u . s . s . enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960 ' s series , star trek . gone are kirk , spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation . as usual , a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again . this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f . murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist ' s will . it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists . of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong , so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists . insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films . the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group . in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction . it doesn ' t do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line . many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek - fan - only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat . the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense . there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ? the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abraham ' s aliens who number only a couple of dozen . so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that ' s plausible . but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever . the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn ) , the trusty klingon . worf was on star trek : the next generation , so they want to include him in the films . no problem so far . worf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine , so the writers have to find a way to have him show up . in the last star trek movie , first contact , the included worf in a credible fashion , in this one , the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie . what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren ' t hanging on every word on the screen . my minor problems with the movie aside , star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones . while many of the jokes do miss the mark , many are pretty good , even for non - trekkies . the special effects are among the best for the star trek series . the action is plentiful and well done . this is a very good - looking movie . it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate . it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade . they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster . most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series . if you ' ve always hated star trek , there is nothing here that is going to change your mind . star trek : insurrection is not the best film in the series , but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones .",pos,jean luc picard patrick stewart rest crew u enterprise be back third outing ninth film base series star trek go be kirk spock mccoy wake very able very talented cast star trek next generation usual crisis be brew be crew enterprise make galaxy safe again time united federation planet alien race lead murray abraham be try move colonist planet colonist s will turn planet be fountain youth federation alien buddy feel be be use good just few colonist course picard feel sort treachery be wrong so disobey direct order vow help protect colonist insurrection be light movie last star trek film film focus lofty question right society whole outweigh right small group respect get back root star trek disguise social commentary science fiction doesn t do bad job other try inject too much humor story line many joke be typical inside star trek fan only joke many other just fall flat other criticism have story be ignore common sense be only few people whole planet why do have be move explanation be planet have be bombard deadly radiation fountain youth effect be strong enough help heal murray abraham alien number only couple dozen so basic story line be bad enough have few be boot few least plausible reality have few be move benefit few dozen make sense whatsoever other little hiccup logic be inclusion worf michael dorn trusty klingon worf be star trek next generation so want include film problem so far worf be now character star trek deep space writer have find way have show last star trek movie first contact include worf credible fashion one writer be so lazy completely glos why be even movie little explanation do give be so small have miss weren t hang word screen minor problem movie aside star trek insurrection do have overwhelming number good point compare bad one many joke do miss mark many be pretty good even non - trekkie special effect be good star trek series action be plentiful well do be very good look movie come surprise ever watch star trek next generation acting be first rate be very obvious actor have be work together decade interact other skill few other ensemble cast muster most star trek fan probably be disappoint late film series ' ve always hate star trek be here be go change mind star trek insurrection be good film series be good enough dispel long stand tradition odd numbered film series be far inferior even number one

179,"in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy ' s jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year ' s smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system . apparently , it was just lying dormant . with ivan reitman ' s enjoyable romantic comedy / adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons . ford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken - down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island . of course , the sophisticated robin and the salt - of - the - earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting . while some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche . both actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon . naturally , there ' s nothing like a life - threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin ' s warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates . granted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked - on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes . but the point is to get the two together , and their newfound affection causes complications for both , but mostly robin , who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank ( david schwimmer ) , who frantically awaits her return on the home island . reitman , and old , reliable hand at breezy comedies , keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action - oriented sequences . his big accomplishment , however , is bringing the old , smiling ford back . as appealing and charismatic as he always is , ford hasn ' t been quite this charming and affable in years ; he ' s obviously having a blast , and the audience cannot help but have one along with him . holding her own is heche , whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be ( as the plane goes down , she frantically pops stress pills ) . she can take her lumps , physical and otherwise , just as well as quinn , making her a formidable foil and ideal match . formulaic and light as a feather , _six_days , _seven_nights_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer "" popcorn "" movie season ' s lack of substance . it ' s certainly fluff , but it ' s unpretentious , undemanding , and -- most importantly -- fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach . pass the popcorn .",pos,recent year harrison ford have be grave screen presence scowl like tom clancy jack ryan series _ the_fugitive _ last year s smash _ air_force_one _ wonder rogue charm make superstar have be completely drain system apparently be just lie dormant ivan reitman enjoyable romantic comedy adventure _ six_day _ seven_night _ lovable scoundrel be back give audience fresh reminder why ford be most enduring popular modern screen icon ford play quinn harris carefree slightly slobby endearingly so pilot tropic break plane crash storm strand charter new york magazine editor robin monroe anne heche deserted island course sophisticated robin salt earth quinn be odd long plane go down manner hostile repartee be exchange first meeting line fall flat formulaic motion work unexpectedly electric chemistry ford heche actor have largely do serious work late seem liberate lack dramatic weight shoulder deliver zinger as weak sometimes be beguile abandon naturally life threaten crisis bring people together quinn robin s warmup other be speed even far arrival bloodthirsty pirate grant conflict need be introduce island tack development writer michael brown be bit too obviously throw purpose add gratuitous action scene point be get together newfound affection cause complication mostly robin come island vacation fiance frank david schwimmer frantically await return home island reitman old reliable hand breezy comedy keep pace brisk capably handle more action orient sequence big accomplishment however be bring old smile ford back appealing charismatic always be ford hasn t be charming affable year ' s obviously have blast audience help have hold own be heche scrappy character never become scream ninny initially promise be plane go down frantically pop stress pill take lump physical otherwise just as well quinn make formidable foil ideal match formulaic light feather _ six_days _ seven_night _ be cite classic example summer popcorn movie season lack substance ' certainly fluff ' unpretentious undemande most importantly fun fluff go as easily frothy pina colada balmy tropical beach pass popcorn
180,"one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb ' s runaway hit dawson ' s creek . following in the foot steps of mtv ' s two other live action films , joe ' s apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace . set in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john "" mox "" moxon ( van der beek ) . we know he ' s smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook . coach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him . the star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) . also on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african - american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin . when lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies . his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there ' s a big game at the end . guess who wins ? nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love . there ' s a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow . van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes . also , the role isn ' t very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character . he ' s still a pseudo - intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock . voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out . the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don ' t fare much better . on the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 ) . scott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team ' s wild man . larter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film ' s most interesting costumes , including a very eye - opening "" whipped cream bikini . "" it ' s interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r - rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) . all this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson ' s creek , presumably the target audience for the picture . director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger ( from nickelodeon films , a sister company of mtv ) and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression . the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it . the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out . there ' s an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul , foo fighters , green day and aaliyah but it ' s not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film .",neg,first film be mtv picture release mark first lead feature role jame van der beek star wb runaway hit dawson creek follow foot step mtv s other live action film joe s apartment dead man campus varsity blue be bad film be unlikely cause much sensation marketplace set west cannan texas film examine small town obsession high school football eye second string quarterback john mox van der beek know ' s smart read kurt vonnegut instead playbook coach bud kilmer jon voight have be around so long be actually bronze statue commemorate star quarterback lance harbor paul walker be handsome blonde hero have own billboard front yard date sexy head cheerleader darcy ali lart also team be enormous guy ron lester health problem token african american team member eliel swinton only real dialogue scene deal directly color skin when lance be seriously injure mox get chance shine run undermine kilmer unusual playing strategy relationship dutiful girlfriend jule amy smart be threaten s big game end guess win varsity blue be inspire whole film simply move sort conventional motion coach kilmer love s chance smart satire small town obsession humor here be decidedly lowbrow van der beek do decent job carry first film silly accent trip sometimes also role isn t very much stretch dawson leary character ' s still pseudo - intellectual whiny nice guy here also happen be jock voight be terror chew single piece scenery spit other adult be all notably awful young performer don t fare much well positive side walker be charismatic actor be due breakout role follow support turn pleasantville scott son jame caan have lively moment tweeder team wild man lart gorgeous seductress look way ticket texas get show film most interesting costume include very eye open whip cream bikini ' s interesting note film definitely earn r rating lot harsh language alcohol abuse unusually high amount nudity include gratuitous trip strip bar reveal very surprising surprise be likely come shock young female fan base dawson s creek presumably target audience picture director brian robbin previously helm kid feature good burger nickelodeon film sister company mtv change direction here bit still fail make much impression look movie be as bland town character populate football scene be generally unexciting entire film look bit wash s ok soundtrack feature music collective soul foo fighter green day aaliyah ' s as impressive expect mtv film

182,"there was a lot riding on this movie . everyone even moderately interested in the "" scream "" series was dying to know how it would end . what would be the "" final act "" ? this is the end of an era for them , a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet , talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies , and , for kids under 17 , those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into "" scream "" while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves . no need to worry ; "" scream 3 "" is endlessly inventive and entertaining , a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name , reinvented the horror genre , and continued in the self - referential , post - modern tradition of quentin and co . so , how does the story go ? as opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe , sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , now all - grown - up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche , is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress , but rather in upstate california , living , understandably , alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems . she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone . but that ? ? ? s not where the movie starts off . instead , in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar , and conceptually horrifying , sequence in "" eye for an eye "" ( 1995 ) , cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , now a big star , drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls , demands the location of sidney ? ? ? s home , and , when he doesn ? ? ? t get it , threatens the life of cotton ? ? ? s girlfriend christine , and cotton can ? ? ? t do anything to stop him . the rest of the sequence is particularly clever , setting up a constant throughout the picture : the killer has a high - tech electronic voice - changer that tops that of the first two . not only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice - over artist roger jackson ( ha , ha ) , he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters , including sidney , and the returned gale weathers ( courtney cox arquette ) and dewey riley ( david arquette ) . at the same time , stab 3 , the third film - within - a - film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college , has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro ; whereas the account of the first two films was true , the franchise within "" scream "" has now become totally fictional . nevertheless , we learn , cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production , as himself to be killed off in the first scene . so , it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie ? ? ' either the actor portraying them , or the real thing . sometimes both . clever , indeed . but , who goes next ? no one knows . three different scripts were penned , we ? ? ? re told , to keep the true finale off the internet ( a nod to the "" scream "" 2 fiasco a few years back ) and no one knows for sure which one the killer read . still , all the while sidney stays concealed in her home , only visiting dad for the first half - hour of the film , while also having horrifying visions of her mother , which takes us back a bit to sidney ? ? ? s fear of becoming what her mother was ? ? ' or , at least , what her mother was secretly . when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent , she ? ? ? s chased onto the set of stab 3 , wandering through "" woodsboro , "" written and directed as an odd , surreal , nightmare indeed , this is one of "" scream 3 "" ? ? ? s finest moments . okay , over the years , i ? ? ? ll admit that i ? ? ? ve become quite the "" scream "" fan . no , i don ? ? ? t have the ghostface costume or the director ? ? ? s cut laserdisc , but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo , and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films ( yes , i said "" dramatic element "" ) , sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with "" scream "" . throughout the film , though , i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films . granted that there ? ? ? s stabbin - a - plenty going on throughout , but there ? ? ? s considerably less blood , less gore . honestly , i like this approach . it ? ? ? s more classical , more rebellious , constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven . he knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy , illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience . some critics have noted that "" scream 3 "" seems to take itself more seriously this time ; maybe so , or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger ( arlington road ) , who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts , saw an opportunity for true irony ? ? ' maybe even a little bit of satire ? ? ' if the film worked in a few more clich ? ? s . what puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film , i ? ? ? m afraid , is the ending , or , rather , the identity of the killer . it does the job , i guess , accomplishes what it should , bringing the three films full circle , but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived , too arbitrary ; after a second viewing , which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation , the killer ? ? ? s identity still seems a little too random , but his motivation came across more sound this time around , and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying . all in all , "" scream 3 "" does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy : it is not the worst of the films . as a trilogy , "" scream "" was a lot of fun ; refreshing , humorous , offbeat . almost sad to see it go . but then , it does seem best to quit while you ?

184,"the happy bastard ' s quick movie review wild wild west a better name for this movie might ' ve been "" wild wild waste "" . warner bros . , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib ' s success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big - screen update to the classic western / sci - fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad . but somehow , they ran into a problem along the way . they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would ' ve made all the difference - a story writer . wild wild west ' s story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon . if warner bros . had gotten him , the movie would ' ve possibly been five times better than what it is . heck , ten times . as is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he ' s performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well . here ' s the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam - controlled wheelchair . they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80 - foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path . as i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess . but the acting doesn ' t help either . kevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado . smith seems to be having a better time as west , although he ' s not nearly as charming as he was in mib . branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can ' t even stand to look at him or his strange beard . and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention . her acting is barely passable , but what a "" breath of fresh ass "" . director barry sonnenfeld isn ' t of great help either . even though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost . it ' s as if he feels he ' s directing a tv movie , a big no - no when you ' re helming what ' s supposed to be a big - screen hit . last but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable . at one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline ' s train . he jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train - while it ' s still in motion ! also , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks . last but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he ' s not kissing a woman as he ' s looking through a peephole at the enemy ? ! the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects . the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show . there ' s also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity . i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn ' t possible . if the racist and sex jokes don ' t bother you , the performances will . if the performances don ' t bother you , the story will . if the story doesn ' t bother you , the racist and sex jokes will . there ' s no end to the vicious circle . go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats . you ' ll have a better time . if you do go , keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant . i bet he wishes he were somewhere else . . .",neg,happy bastard quick movie review wild wild west well name movie ' ve be wild wild waste warner bro attempt get own man black style movie have manage lasso big name actor smith director barry sonnenfeld duo mib success order get own fourth july blockbuster contemporary big screen update classic western sci fi series wild wild west star robert conrad somehow run problem way be so busy try fill specific role forget general ' ve make difference story writer wild wild west story script be compile different people rather just one put brilliant touch man black ed solomon warner bro have get movie ' ve possibly be time well be time be however story screenplay be mess fill dead laugh enough racist sex joke make even cringe ' s perform complete lack chemistry make tv show work so well here s story army member jam west smith team creative genius artemus gordon kevin kline take ruthless villain name arliss loveless kenneth branagh low half be blow civil war leave roll steam control wheelchair catch plot involve superweapon basically be consider foot tarantula look big hellbent destroy path say way script unfold be complete mess act doesn t help either kevin kline be miserable gordon fail display even smidgeon care do western silverado smith seem be have well time west ' s nearly as charming be mib branagh go excessively top villain perhaps point where ' t even stand look strange beard salma hayek be along ride search miss father mostly exist just sexual attention acting be barely passable breath fresh ass director barry sonnenfeld t great help either even show good creativity point overall urgency directing be lose ' s feel ' direct tv movie big no when ' helm s suppose be big screen hit last least be huge gap logic be just plain unacceptable point smith defy gravity when first boarding kline train jump back get launch straight up air somehow manage land car ahead train ' s still motion also seem be strangely comfortable talk racism front lynch mob particularly consider fact family be kill like such folk last least why be still make kissing face when know ' s kiss woman ' s look peephole enemy only save grace wild wild west come mostly form special effect huge mechanical spider be technical marvel very authentic looking considerable creativity show s also good sequence involve metal magnet neckbrace spin saw blade again logic question come play regard polarity say sit back have good time wild wild west really isn t possible racist sex joke don t bother performance performance don t bother story story doesn t bother racist sex joke ' s end vicious circle go rent man black instead pretend smith tommy lee jone be wear cowboy hat have well time do go keep eye robert conrad role president grant bet wish be somewhere else

187,"last summer , a feature - length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . based on the famous 60 ' s television show , the film was an enormous box - office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . but it sounded promising : the same tag - team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . and co - star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . i mean , what could possibly go wrong ? the answer is just about everything . wild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . there are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . but the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . at square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . will smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . my guess regarding the casting of african - american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . he ' s too much of a joker . i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self - assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . the plot involves west and cross - dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . the trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . loveless has taken the country ' s top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . one such weapon is an 80 - foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer - generated imagery with the western surroundings . unfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film ' s plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . most of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . if it ' s one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it ' s the performances , and even they are mostly off - kilter and poorly delivered . kline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . branagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . but even he is so utterly weird and over - the - top . rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . i suppose there ' s always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big - budget release that manages to completely disappoint . wild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . perhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith ' s name stamped on a summer movie . after such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume .",neg,last summer feature length version avenger hit theater tune unanimous critical panning base famous television show film be enormous box office flop huge disappointment warner bro year later studio be old trick again unnecessary revival robert conrad program wild wild west sound promise same tag team star smith director barry sonnenfeld contribute make man black financial success be rein again co - star kevin kline be attach project as well substantial budget spice special effect mean possibly go wrong answer be just wild wild west be cinematic abomination film be so entirely pointless begin be never give proper chance get gate be lot fancy special effect handful distinguished actor try desperately tunnel inane plot make last impression script be so deliriously uneven entire movie so course human being technical achievement have chance salvage square have bizarre case casting smith play james west renegade cowboy be originally play white actor robert conrad tv series guess regard casting african american smith be simple one actor cozy summertime release big buck involve smith be very talented performer usually bring swift assurance comic relief material be ideal role ' s too much joker hear initial casting include george clooney lead role frankly sound lot more plausible make matter bad be smith go role such self assurance eye practically sense contentment fact know wild wild west be huge hit summer box office plot involve west cross - dressing government agent artemus gordon kevin kline be assign president recover group kidnapped scientist trail lead diabolical dr arliss loveless kenneth branagh man low body speak dry witty southern accent loveless have take country top technical mind hostage assist deranged plan total government control use lethal superweapon destroy entire town such weapon be foot mechanical tarantula bear spindly leg thrash metal spew enormous fireball leave right visual effect bring metallic bug life be spectacular seamlessly blend computer generate imagery western surrounding unfortunately effect seem so detached story do little support film plot deficiency be undoubtedly main problem wild wild west be running gag never truly work most joke usually care smith die arrival ' thing possibly be save grace ' s performance even be mostly kilter poorly deliver kline be admirable have little do invent silly device spot salma hayek be waste romantic interest be view little more window dressing look pretty create conflict west gordon branagh esteemed shakespearean actor director add marginal enjoyment film even be so utterly weird top rarely be film so lose wild wild west be suppose s always turkey summer season highly anticipate big budget release manage completely disappoint wild wild west be movie probably go big disappointment be highly unlikely go defeat box office perhaps audience be less assured when see smith name stamp summer movie such hit independence day mib wild wild west be impressive addition resume
188,"sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film . sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride . i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes . surprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say . but by the attentiveness of the crowd i ' d say they were won over - as was i . i can ' t tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year . time alone will make that call . but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank ' s side . we were concerned for his well - being , and wanted him to win . that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last . the truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot . unless you ' re under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics . carrey stars as truman burbank , a capra - esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner ' s idea of the perfect american small town . truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co - workers . there is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good . but then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky . this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world ' s biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world ' s most popular television program . what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir . the soundstage , we ' re told , is "" only the second man - made structure visible from space . "" truman ' s movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams . weir cuts the film so we ' re never quite sure if we ' re watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show ' s omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man - made moon in seahaven ' s sky . the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence . his best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him . his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product . he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town . one wonders why he didn ' t pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : "" people tend to accept the reality with which they ' re presented .

190,"warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film "" fail - safe . "" if you haven ' t seen the film yet , proceed with caution . nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama . still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war . -------------------- "" fail - safe "" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet review by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn ' t have a winning side and a losing side . in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world -- assuming the world survives . the idea -- and perhaps the only real option -- is to avoid war at all costs . this is the theme of sidney lumet ' s "" fail - safe , "" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler . "" fail - safe "" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism . the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws . five u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america . the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers . suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike . a great deal of "" fail - safe "" ' s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia ' s borders -- at any cost . the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios . the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails . general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless -- the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre - programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no - win situation winnable . the events in "" fail - safe "" are fascinating because they ' re anything but predictable , but the real reason "" fail - safe "" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot . a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states ' role in all of it . most of this is through the film ' s use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president ' s advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war . many of the film ' s most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices . early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of "" strategy "" in a nuclear assault to "" minimize "" casualties . "" what ' s the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? "" a guest asks impatiently . "" forty million , "" groeteschele responds wryly . the problem with groeteschele ' s mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o ' herlihy ) has often recommended . on the contrary -- according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . "" fail - safe "" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? is it wise ? is it even logical ? no , not really . although "" fail - safe "" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one - sided sort of way . again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film ' s most important character in terms of the larger - theme significance . in addition to providing the central "" pro - nuclear war "" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . one of groeteschele ' s "" logical "" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it ' s merely absurd . he labels the average marxist an "" unfeeling , calculating machine "" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter - measures that would further destroy russia ' s home soil -- which must be preserved at all costs . groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge -- as any normal person would . the irony here is groeteschele ' s own mechanical theorizing . he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn ' t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . once the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . just how will the soviet union ' s leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) with the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet ' s long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . without getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear "" incident "" can probably be . ) it does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all - out war , something that simply isn ' t possible because of its all - too - real consequences . dramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o ' herlihy ' s character as the symbolic "" matador "" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film ' s opening ) , is particularly appropriate . "" fail - safe "" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high - tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . nevertheless , under lumet ' s direction and walter bernstein ' s intelligent adaptation of burdick ' s and wheeler ' s novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . but it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that "" fail - safe "" also finds dangerous . in retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . it ' s just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele ' s dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown .",pos,warn review contain spoiler film fail safe haven t see film yet proceed caution relevant intelligent suspenseful drama still powerful today even end cold war fail safe usa drama minute screenplay walter bernstein base novel eugene burdick harvey wheeler produce max e youngstein direct sidney lumet review jamahl epsicokhan most ironic aspect nuclear war be doesn t have win side losing side nuclear confrontation lose aftereffect have devastating effect impact entire world assume world survive idea perhaps only real option be avoid war cost be theme sidney lumet fail safe fictional drama base novel eugene burdick harvey wheeler fail safe take place heart cold war actual film be release year cuban missile crisis when united state soviet union be static discord issue be summarize single word communism premise center combination accident operation flaw u bomber carry nuclear warhead be order set routine course moscow unidentified aircraft be spot head america unidentified aircraft turn be commercial airliner mechanical failure strike military base command bomber suddenly contact stand order remain course receive new directive bomber pilot be recall proceed moscow intention destroy nuclear strike great deal fail safe plot follow various character attempt devise way stop u bomber reach russia s border cost plot be compelling story create urgency dread paint grimmest bad case scenario reality set quickly attempt turn bomber fail general bogan frank overton take order directly president united state henry fonda be powerless fate world lie hand automate pre -

191,"a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy , with its main asset being a beautiful film location along spain ' s mountainous coastline . howard pigeon ( jeff goldblum ) is a 40 -

life crises , worried that he looks older than his age . he incessantly talks to himself , mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for a second time , and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive . he stutters and acts like a man who has lost his confidence . things change on their vacation , as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch . he nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room . by accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting . when other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot , he nervously explains that it was the tv . realizing how unworkable his plan is , he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth . but elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip , and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotel ' s 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room , she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him . as a result , he goes to the police to report her missing . while with the police , a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone . his boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him , and he gets a job promotion . but soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water , giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home . there they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder . the police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room . in jail , things look bad for him . no one believes him , including his friends and lawyer . his boss fires him and the papers have a field day with the headline story : pigeon : a jailbird . out on bail , he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife . through a call placed on his credit card , he tracks her down to a mountain resort . once there he learns that she took a hike up the steep mountain and he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story . the film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance . he is someone coming apart by the seams , while mimi rogers is his perfect foil . it was mostly pantomine humor , with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation . a very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd . the film just didn ' t take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it , so it had no chance for black humor to develop . it instead played its set -

director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them , with some nice camera tricks , but even this is missing from this stilted affair . wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing , but not much of it is evident , making this film drag out even more . it ' s a sad thing when _four_ ( credited ) screenwriters , a talented director and a willing star can ' t make a film work , and eventually wild wild west collapses under it ' s sexist , mildly racist , unfunny weight .",neg,summer movie be nature dumb affair be usually make quick enjoyment make money wild wild west late smith affair follow much same formula be dumb less enjoy most summer movie smith play jim west black sheriff nice line sunglass be call president grant kline go mission find why top government scientist be disappear west be pair scientist artemus gordon kline again track miss scientist legless mastermind name dr loveless branagh zany moustache pile many negative sorry affair ' give chance positive s nice credit sequence production design welch be pleasing eye special effect be decent enough s also pleasant soundtrack bury deep dross be amusing joke salma hayek pop female interest be always nice see apart factor though else wild wild west work firstly little chemistry smith kline appear be purely money expect zinger pass none arise plod below standard plot know be pay cheque wait end even kenneth branagh provide much entertainment be top material doesn t present much opportunity branagh be truly crazy therefore just come as loud obnoxious only enjoyable performance come sexy salma hayek be give so little screen time ' embarrassing appear be film merely show body be ogle kline smith character also change whim fit mechanic script be sense realism character humour film be also very off smith put little spin daft line man black here even smith save humour display script largely boil insult aren t very funny liner barely raise smirk ' s also somewhat racist doesn t intend be scene jim west try wisecrack way lynching actually say slavery be good save ' s funny scene whole thing come rather uncomfortably film also make tragic mistake man case kline dress be automatically unfunny isn t wild wild west make joke even more painful watch pure ineptness s also problem plot jim west artemus gordon get catch kind sticky situation way get be always unsatisfying rely purely luck rather audience pleasing skill plot element be introduce film then throw away just as quickly main piece story foot mechanical steam drive spider devise loveless look rather impressive ' s particular reason why be build why loveles build great big tank instead ungainly fragile piece machinery s just beg be blow director barry sonnenfeld always have breezy look nice camera trick even be miss stilte affair wild wild west have benefit sonnenfeld whack style directing much be evident make film drag even more ' s sad thing when _ credit screenwriter talented director willing star ' t make film work eventually wild wild west collapse s sexist mildly racist unfunny weight
193,"robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god - given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people . in "" the natural "" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be "" the best there ever was , "" but still acted like a humble farm boy . in "" butch cassidy and the sundance kid "" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good - looking charmer . even in "" indecent proposal "" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love . in his latest film , "" the horse whisperer , "" based on the best - selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character . redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up . despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase "" horse whisperer "" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life . booker ' s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident . the accident , which is filmed with gut - wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen - wheeler kills grace ' s friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace ' s horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg . annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker . at first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn ' t work . instead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister - in - law , diane ( dianne wiest ) . in many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically . the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it ' s hard not to see annie and grace ' s leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country . in "" the horse whisperer , "" country is clearly the victor . the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide - open spaces of montana that grace ' s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie ' s controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people . redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed "" a river runs through it "" six years ago . in many ways , "" the horse whisperer "" comes from the same poetic vein as "" river , "" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera - time on the grass and mountains . but then , that would ruin the magic . much of the film ' s photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land . to further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( "" natural born killers , "" "" platoon "" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft - focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . in terms of the story itself , "" the horse whisperer "" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean ' s "" a brief encounter "" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood ' s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller ' s "" the bridges of madison county "" ( richard lagravenese , co - screenwriter here also adapted "" bridges "" ) . although "" the horse whisperer "" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story . it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who ' s being left behind for this brief , heart - sweeping affair , but there rarely is . in "" the horse whisperer , "" the thankless role of being the fuddy - duddy husband falls to sam neill . he plays the character as a decent , hard - working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him . he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man . there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character . it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out - of - place in a baseball cap . as they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him . it ' s a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie ' s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness . after all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it . the best scenes in "" the horse whisperer "" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse . although booker ' s horse - training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing . these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true . at some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more . nevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . there are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow - dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together . although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make "" the horse whisperer "" worth the price of admission .",pos,robert redford be very good play character have incredible give gift be able act ordinary people natural play fallen angelic character roy hobb baseball player be destine be good ever be still act humble farm boy butch cassidy sundance kid be most dangerous shot west come more boyishly good look charmer even indecent proposal where play man be so good make money believe buy love redford be still able exude aura shy decency especially when recite tale lose love late film horse whisperer base well sell novel nichola evan redford again play character redford also direct film swear never direct movie suppose character tom booker man have amazing gift understanding somehow communicate horse be just too good pass enormous rare gift when come train troubled horse magazine article coin phrase horse whisperer describe uncanny talent booker see everyday cattle rancher great fear be grow old no long have purpose life booker talent be tax service annie maclean kristin scott thoma new york magazine editor daughter grace scarlett johansson be recently horrible accident accident be film gut wrench horror happen when grace good friend be out ride horse wheeler kill grace s friend severely wound traumatize grace horse pilgrim cause grace lose part right leg annie believe pilgrim be heal grace be heal as well lead booker first try get booker come new york see horse doesn t work instead pack grace pilgrim leave husband robert sam neill behind head roll hill montana where booker run ranch brother frank chris cooper sister law diane dianne wiest many way film be journey literally symbolically move west have always be great american tradition renewal ' s hard see annie grace leave manhattan montana variation classic theme city . country horse whisperer country be clearly victor city be characterize claustrophobia unhappiness be character arrive wide open space montana grace anger be physically emotionally crippled begin dissipate annie control nature begin relax pilgrim once again learn trust people redford be just love grand montana country film be when direct river run year ago many way horse whisperer come same poetic vein river movie probably be good minute shorter redford have decide spend less camera time grass mountain then ruin magic much film photography be truly elegant create palpable sense sheer expansiveness land far emphasize redford cinematographer robert richardson natural bear killer platoon cheat bit shoot beginning film take place new york mostly cold harsh bluish filter more squarish aspect ratio when action shift montana richardson switch soft focus natural lighting screen widen aspect ratio term story horse whisperer give same romanticized view adultery find david lean s brief encounter clint eastwood s adaptation robert jame waller s bridge madison county richard lagravenese co -

194,"by starring in amy heckerling ' s "" clueless "" two summers ago , alicia silverstone proved she wasn ' t just another pretty , pouty ingenue , showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs -- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of "" the crush "" -- out of the water . her only work since that 1995 gem has been in june ' s "" batman & robin , "" where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl . now , she ' s the star and producer of "" excess baggage , "" a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill - composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level . silverstone ' s emily t . hope is stuck with a billionaire father ( jack thompson ) who neglects her emotionally . in an outlandish plan to gain his affection , she fakes her own kidnapping -- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom , ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw . but before the police can "" rescue "" her , professional auto thief vincent roche ( benicio del toro ) jimmies the locks , hot - wires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily , who ' s still trapped in the back . when vincent discovers emily , the two don ' t exactly hit it off -- she annoys him , he annoys her , and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner ( harry connick , jr . ) , he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there . along the way , of course , they get into a whole heap of trouble , and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky , felony - studded situation . it doesn ' t help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops , crooks and even her shady uncle ray ( christopher walken ) , who ' s wise to his niece ' s ploys for attention and has mafia connections . for at least a half - hour , "" excess baggage "" bounces along fast and efficiently . during this time , emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role - reversal twist -- she ' s an awfully aggressive , combative victim and he ' s quite the aloof , seemingly vulnerable captor . but once it ' s past its set - up , the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once . a road movie , a teen comedy , a mob thriller , a drama about family relationships -- you name the cliche and "" excess baggage "" likely covers its territory . of course a romance develops between the two leads , but it all seems forced , and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome . "" do you like my tummy ? "" emily coos to vincent at one point in the film . huh ? did i miss something ? the hard - edged , foul - mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with a pair of batting goo - goo eyes . then again , "" excess baggage "" becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not a complete surprise . a supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles , but the movie isn ' t game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded . motivations keep shifting , resulting in an often confusing narrative . scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions . "" excess baggage "" has too many characters , too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and a remaining shaky hand . i loved silverstone ' s turn in "" clueless "" as an aloof , pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen ' s "" emma .

195,"i won  t even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films . i saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3 , but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them . so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective : alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard day  s work . i didn  t just dislike it so much because the plot was awful ; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing  but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning . sigourney weaver , who  s role in alien earned her an academy award nomination , plays the character of  ripley ,  who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3 . 200 years later , scientists  use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley - including the alien that was stuck inside her . in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two ; yet ripley is now not completely human , possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being . i  m sure someone can explain exactly why this is so , but for now we  ll just ignore it and move on . why , you ask , would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated ? well , the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature . these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research . they ( yawn ) were wrong . it doesn  t take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un - flossed teeth . there  s a little saying that goes something like this :  if you  re going to make a bad film , do it well .  i have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies , but they are not the ones that really bother me . alien resurrection , a good example of a film that really gets up my nose , is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one . there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore , which attempts to distract us from the wandering - but - not - going - anywhere plot . in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off . another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to . fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story , but this is unfortunately not the case , and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable . if you think i  m struggling to find one good aspect about the film , then you thought right . one exciting scene is a credit ( and the only part remotely worth seeing ) to the film , in which an alien chases two men ( one a cripple ) up a tall ladder with interesting results . but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard , and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis . so in a film where the one liners come as bad as  earth man , what a shit hole  and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent , its no wonder why alien : resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is . oh , and in case you  re wondering about my bag of lollies  the less i enjoy a film , the more i eat . so all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes ; but however empty the bag turned out to be , it was still a long way ahead of the movie ",neg,win  t even pretend have see other alien film see glimpse alien alien fragment alien have mean actually sit watch so take opinion unbiased impartial perspective alien resurrection be worth large bag lolly be munch hard day  work didn  t just dislike so much plot be awful most acting be very average special effect get tiresome minute painful view  also fact tedious ingredient throw attempt give pointless dribble meaning sigourney weaver  role alien earn academy award nomination play character  ripley  die fight extraterrestrial scum alien year later scientist  use sample blood find site death recreate ripley include alien be stick time remove alien body separate ripley be now completely human possess strange amount strength be able withhold great pain normal being  m sure explain exactly why be so now  just ignore move why ask ripley alien be recreate smart little lab researcher believe be able discover many advancement science study alien creature be same people say control alien be danger research yawn be wrong doesn  t take genius figure rest film be continuous cat mouse chase human die alien open mouth possible occasion show frightfully scary un - flossed tooth  s little saying go   go make bad film do well have see plenty disappointing underachieving movie be one really bother alien resurrection good example film really get nose be so much discourage experience off put be way describe why australian ma rating be give film other unnecessary repulsive gore attempt distract wandering go anywhere plot scene stomach churn witness mawkish look alien put hand character head literally rip most face feature ripley stick knife hand just impress be talk fair enough be horror film even bare significance story be unfortunately case sort bizarre gore be inexcusable think  m struggle find good aspect film then think exciting scene be credit only part remotely worth see film alien chase man cripple tall ladder interesting result course thrilling scene alien resurrection have problem return pathetically low standard end crash shore movie dullness more often japanese kamikaze jet fighter fall ski so film where liner come as bad  earth man shit hole primary mean man strategic attack be bounce bullet wall hit opponent wonder why alien resurrection turn be put clumsy be case  wonder bag lolly  less enjoy film more eat so lolly be go minute however empty bag turn be be still long way ahead movie
196,"the cartoon is way better . that ' s the bottom line on disney ' s incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature . the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic "" home alone "" with puppies , and not much else . when production of this remake was announced , the big question seemed to be "" why ? the original cartoon still works , so what ' s the point ? "" the answer , it appears , is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign . the story , for those of you who missed childhood , is simple . two dalmatians , pongo and perdy , fall in love at first sight . they drag their "" human pets "" together , and in a short time both couples marry . the heavenly match - ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy ' s new - born pups are stolen ; their dog - napping engineered by the evil cruella devil , who wants them for their pelts . everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies . in the original movie , the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities . we also could hear them talk , which quickly established a crucial element to the charm of the film , the dog ' s view of humans as their pets . in the new version , the dogs are mute and expressionless . hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks . while he drew the desired "" aww , they ' re so cute "" reaction from the audience , it was quickly followed by several people whispering "" i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dog ' s heads to get them licking like that ? "" the canines ' lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little . joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles . in previous films , daniels successfully played off his white bread persona . in "" something wild "" , he revealed the rebellious thrill - seeker beneath his neutral demeanor . in "" terms of endearment "" , his hapless appearance masked a cold , manipulative womanizer . here , he and richardson are so consistently bland that it ' s a wonder their images even stick to the film . glenn close , however , has no problems establishing a distinct personality . as the villainous icon cruella devil , she tears up the screen in a deliciously over - the - top performance . close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself . with a two - tone fright wig , red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips , garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels , close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature . she ' s clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon , and her wicked glee is infectious . when she spits out lines like "" you ' ve won the battle , but i ' m about to win the wardrobe ! , "" the film comes briefly to life . "" 101 dalmatians "" is crammed with john hughes ' typical heavy - handed approach to comedy . after an ingenuous opening showing pongo ' s morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day , the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park . a little slapstick goes a long way , but hughes just keeps laying it on . the second half of the film , where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen , is a tedious home alone clone , with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy & scratchy cartoon , including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence .

197,"dr . alan grant ( sam neill , "" jurassic park "" ) is becoming disillusioned . paleontology is no longer the sexy science it once was since the ingen corporation cloned his subject matter . his lectures bring people interested in his adventures on isla nubla rather than his research and funding dollars are drying up . when the kirbys ( william h . macy , "" fargo "" ; tea leoni , "" the family man "" ) ask him to be their guide for an anniversary flyover of isla sorna ( the notorious site b of "" the lost world "" ) he ' s disdainful , but once they wave their checkbook , he reconsiders . however the kirbys haven ' t given dr . grant their real agenda in "" jurassic park iii .

what a cast . ok here is the plot in this movie : linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic . one day at her house metatron ( the voice of god ) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels ( matt damon and ben affleck ) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church . ok now get this , she is told to find two prophets : one who talks a lot and one who doesn ' t , however she gets jay and silent bob instead ( who give us great performances ) . now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky ( chris rock ) and helps guide her to find these angels . salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way . azrael ( jason lee ) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win . bethany ( linda fiorentino ) has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith . what a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel - good movie . who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself . now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart . yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god . this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie . kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie . of course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob . probably the best characters in movies that i like . the star - studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while . the script was written by kevin smith with many f ' words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn ' t and makes us laugh at the same time as we think . chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well , with some classic lines . linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is . of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay ( as well as silent bob ) . alan rickman , jason lee , salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles . being oscar winners for the classic ' good will hunting ' they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could . ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story . the movie ' s only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it . however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , ' dogma ' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to ' clerks ' . while being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can ' t deny it . ' dogma ' will offend people , especially deeply religious people , but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you . all kevin smith fans must see ! !",pos,rate r strong language sexual dialogue drug use crude humor violence brief nudity star ben affleck matt damon linda fiorentino salma hayek alan rickman chris rock kevin smith jason mewe jason lee george carlin alanis morissette run time minute be huge fan kevin smith be expect lot new project dogma just be kevin good work date ' s very funny smart foul mouthed dialogue unexpectedly have serious undertone go god jesus christ actually try tell people be thing rather isn t little movie premiere sundance little film be call clerk little film go become huge video sensation really ' t meet person green earth have see clerk be hail critic good movie year soon sequel be come kevin make movie mallrat flop horribly think be good movie ever make be pretty good little flick be pan critic hail audience chase amy come be kevin big success date now get great little movie name dogma cast ok here be plot movie linda fiorentino play regular woman work abortion clinic day house metatron voice god appear house much surprise tell stop fallen angel matt damon ben affleck get back heaven way church ok now get be tell find prophet talk lot doesn t however get jay silent bob instead give great performance now way new jersey jay silent bob try stop angel 13th apostle fall sky chris rock help guide find angel salma hayek play serendipity also help way azrael jason lee be demon be try help angel win bethany linda fiorentino have now use help people try stop angel cheat way back heaven lead violent bloody end make think twice faith movie be roll offensive offbeat smart sassy comedy surprisingly have great message end end be feel good movie have know kevin have soft side make know be faithful person now get offend movie really take heart target catholic community bash lot also seem rather go god heaven actually go god kevin give message be god review sound confusing first really only way understand be see excellent movie kevin go new length hilarious comedy give great character too much background study rather start know character watch movie course good funniest be only duo history have make fall chair laughing friend be jay silent bob probably good character movie like star stud cast be amazing have other cameo george carlin jeanne garafolo so more start lose track while script be write kevin smith many word there course strong emphasis sexual talk also seem concentrate be important rather isn t make laugh same time think chris rock give hilarious performance get character very well classic line linda fiorentino be just perfect role make believe really be be course jason mewe kevin smith do great job jay silent bob priceless line jay as well silent bob alan rickman jason lee salma hayek round cast matt damon ben affleck star role be oscar winner classic good hunt give great performance here again matt damon seem just little hold back do give ben however be get very much character as well story movie s only big flaw be have few unfunny line slow part go however direction kevin script kevin as well priceless performance many cast member dogma stand new classic think safely compare clerk be funny time end become serious movie important message agree t deny dogma offend people especially deeply religious people be open minded want see very funny material then be movie kevin smith fan see
